{"title": "4 Reasons Why Baby Boomers Should Consider Telecommuting", "text": "March 22, 2015As a generation who\u2019s seen more significant technological advances than probably any other in human history \u2014 from a television in every household to a smartphone in every hand; from landing on the moon to voyaging onto the World Wide Web \u2014 Baby Boomers are, and should be, now beginning to get some mileage from one of the major lifestyle advantages afforded by all these modern tools: working remotely.Common perceptions of working remotely bring up the image of a tech-savvy twenty-something typing away all alone. But, in actuality, the typical telecommuter is closer to 50 years old and belongs to a company of over 100 employees, according to a New York Times reference to the Census Bureau\u2019s annual statistics.With an average income of $58,000, remote workers are undeniably contributing to the current workforce \u2014 and their own well-being. Here are four reasons why:Telecommuting Reduces StressWhen your commute involves simply getting out of bed and walking downstairs the daily pressures of setting an extra early alarm, being held up in traffic, and cursing at drivers who cut you off all before you have your morning cup of coffee categorically disappear.In fact, a recent study found that telecommuting employees see improvement in their stress levels by 82%. Additionally, they experience 80% improvement in morale and 69% improvement in absenteeism. The combination of these factors all point to greater well-being, and pave the way for a healthier relationship with work.Telecommuters Tend to Be More ProductiveHaving the freedom to work in whatever environment breeds the best results is a huge game changer in the arena of productivity. Honing in on a project, undisturbed and in a comfortable setting, can affect work quality as well as efficiency.Stanford University researchers have found that telecommuting employees are more productive, less likely to quit, and happier overall when compared to their office-working counterparts. Even traditional perceptions about remote working are shifting.According to a survey by Dell and Intel, more than half of employees globally now believe that their peers who work from home are just as productive, or more productive, than those who work in the office.Telecommuters Can Travel While WorkingFor those who don\u2019t have to step foot in an office, working remotely means working wherever you are. Since telecommuters can easily email work from anywhere with a wifi, 3G, or LTE connection, project delivery doesn\u2019t depend on handing in a stack of paper.Whether you\u2019re driving up the coast or flying to visit the grandkids, working doesn't have to come to a halt. While it\u2019s definitely smart to designate dedicated downtime (especially if you\u2019re traveling for leisure), remote working allows more flexibility as to where and when you choose to work.Telecommuters Are Able to Spend More Time with FamilyVirgin mogul Richard Branson wrote in a recent company blog post, that working from home absolutely allows him to spend more time with his family and that office-bound work will one day be a thing of the past.According to Branson\u2019s vision of the future, \u201cIn 30 years time, as technology moves forward even further, people are going to look back and wonder why offices ever existed.\u201d Branson has a point; Microsoft points to research indicating that the average employee spends almost 200 hours a year traveling to and from work \u2014 the equivalent of five extra weeks of work!Microsoft also suggests that with family and leisure time at a premium for many professionals, remote work is an excellent alternative for gaining more time to spend doing the things you love with those whom you love.As a valuable part of the workforce, yet no longer Spring chickens, Baby Boomers are wise to seek flexible employment opportunities outside of the office.Whether looking to reduce stress, feel good about greater productivity, gain more freedom to travel, or spend more time with family, remote work is yet another frontier into which Baby Boomers will foray during their lifetimes.More Related to TeleworkingTop 10 Human Resources Trends of the DecadeHow to Negotiate a Flexible ScheduleWork Schedule Choices Employees Love"}
{"title": "What Is a Tracking Stock?", "text": "When I first began running Investing for Beginners back in 2001, a popular question I received was, \"What is a tracking stock?\".  In the years prior, companies had begun spinning off tracking stocks left and right so many investors, including those participating in employee stock purchase plans and dividend reinvestment plans, suddenly found themselves with shares of businesses they didn't quite understand.  Though they are now largely an anachronism, financial history has a tendency of repeating itself so I'm not only going to keep this old article around for posterity, but clarify and expand on it so the next time this particular fashion comes back into vogue on Wall Street, it will be here waiting for you.The basic definition of a tracking stock is simple enough.  A tracking stock is a special type of stock issued by a company to represent a particular division or segment of the business.  Tracking stocks allow management to retain control of the operation without having to sell ownership or create a separate legal entity that is spun off to shareholders, with its own board of directors and management team, while allowing investors the opportunity to value various aspects of an enterprise on different terms and price-to-earnings multiples.  At the time they were used, they were effectively the result of ambitious management teams trying to cash in on the obscene (and stupid) once-in-several-generations valuation levels that seemed to be hitting new highs on an almost daily basis back during the dot-com bubble.  Even stable, old-fashion blue chip stocks got in on the madness.An Example of One Particularly Popular Tracking Stock In what now seems like a lifetime ago and long before its meltdown, Sprint was one of the most attractive telecommunication companies in the United States.  Its traditional landline businesses were highly profitable and paid a rich dividend and it had a new, exciting division that specialized in cell phones, which management was convinced would replace landlines someday; a notion that seemed strange to the typical citizen at the time but one that was often discussed with increasing frequency in the Form 10-K filings.As the Internet boom got out of control, pushing the stock price ever-higher to the point even the dividend yield became non-enticing, Sprint saw that cellular companies were being valued at crazy multiples. The already-richly valued telecommunication utility decided to divide its common stock into two classes of tracking stock trading under two ticker symbols, FON and PCS, somewhat resembling a dual class stock setup but very different from what the classical version of such a capital structure actually represents.  Its classic landline business, the cash cow gushing money from local and long distance plans, was assigned to FON.  Meanwhile, the cellular business was assigned to PCS.  Shareholders were given 1 share of PCS for every 2 shares of FON they held.After hitting the market, the demand for PCS was incredible and a lot of employees in the formerly sleepy world of switchboards and telephone poles became millionaires as speculators drove the price of the cellular division's tracking stock higher.  Things like fundamentals - paying attention to balance sheets and income statements - no longer mattered to people.When the bottom fell out and the growth couldn't match a reasonable dividend adjusted PEG, Sprint's stock began to collapse along with the rest of the overvalued equities on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq (in fact, it took fifteen years for the latter to reach its former high).  The company's board decided to exercise its authority and reassemble the tracking stocks into a single ticker, FON, by exchanging shares of PCS for it, hunkering down to try and make it through the storm.  In 2005, Sprint merged with Nextel.  It didn't do much good for Sprint's long-term equity holders who have suffered a catastrophic loss of purchasing power over the past twenty years.Understanding the Pros and Cons of Tracking StocksThere are several benefits to tracking stocks.A tracking stock can allow management to unlock value by increasing the total stock market capitalization and enterprise value of the business through expansion in the overall p/e ratio.  This makes existing shareholders wealthier as they can sell their appreciated shares to buy other investments, pay down debt, send their children or grandchildren to college, donate to charity, build a new home, take a vacation, or any number of other things.  It also gives the board of directors an appreciated currency in the form of two different shares it can use when making acquisitions, letting it to expand while giving up less intrinsic value.Management retains control over the tracked operating segment or business.On the flip side, there are several drawbacks to tracking stocks.Tracking stocks often have greatly reduced or non-existent voting rights.An owner of a tracking stock might not actually own the specific aspect of the operating segment that is being tracked. In the event of a corporate bankruptcy, the assets of the particular division their tracking stock was supposed to represent would be fair game for the creditors even if the division associated with the tracking stock was extremely profitable and growing rapidly.  This is not the case with traditional spin-offs.  For example, look at the bankruptcy of Eastman Kodak and how it had no effect on its former subsidiary Eastman Chemical.If the market goes south, the tracking stock can be absorbed back into the main stock at a price that may appear unattractive to either or both the owners of the tracking stock and the original corporate stock. This is eventually what happened to Sprint.  There can be resentment and wealth destruction depending upon where you sit."}
{"title": "Avoid These Errors When Starting to Sell on eBay", "text": "eBay has very few barriers to entry, so most new sellers just jump on and start listing. While eBay makes this possible, it is wise to step back, read the eBay policies, and understand what can cause account restriction as well as suspension. eBay doesn't buy \"I didn't know better\" as an excuse when a rule is violated. Make sure you understand these basic rules before starting to sell on eBay.Take Your Own PhotosIt is against eBay policy to use another seller's photos or to steal them off the internet. If using a photo that you did not take, you must have written permission from the owner. The official eBay policy states:You should be sure you have permission from the rights owner or creator before you use the following:Images or text copied from websites or internet searchesStock photos and text Information from product packagingIt's usually OK to use information such as measurements, weight, or other item specifications that are necessary to describe the item that you simply can't say any other way. However, you should avoid using any other text from product packaging unless you have permission from the owner to do so. Images and text copied from listings of other eBay membersScans or text copied from catalogs or advertisementsRead the full policy about eBay Image Theft here. Understand Your Selling LimitsAll sellers have selling limits. If you are brand new to eBay, your limits will likely be as low as 10 items and $500. If you have had an eBay account for several years, but have never sold anything, your limits will be higher because eBay sees you as a trusted community member.Selling limits are sort of hidden on eBay, so here is how to find them:You can see most of your account limits in My eBay and in Seller Hub. Click My eBay at the top of most eBay pages, sign in to your account, then select the All Selling option in the Sell section on the left side of the page (or in the Selling Manager Summary). In Seller Hub, you can see your account limits in the Overview section.Read all the details about Selling Limits here.Learn About the VeRO ProgrameBay has a program called VeRO, which stands for Verified Rights Ownership. Basically, VeRO is a list of companies or brands who don't want their items sold on eBay or insist that the items be authentic. For example, Michael Kors is on the VeRO list, but as long as the item is authentic, it can be listed and sold.The VeRO Participant Profile Page states:To help you safely sell branded products on eBay, we offer the following pages written by intellectual property rights owners and similar organizations that work with eBay.  These pages give information about the brands\u2019 products and legal positions. The rights owners are solely responsible for the content.  Please contact the rights owners directly if you have questions. Some rights owners who work with eBay did not to contribute a page, so the list of brands is not comprehensive. If you commit a VeRO violation, you will receive an email that says,Your auction was most likely terminated because it displayed unauthorized reproductions of copyrighted images or trademarks owned by (company), or because it offered for sale unauthorized merchandise.The listing will be pulled off eBay and your account may be limited.Give It Time: eBay Is a Marathon Not a SprintNew eBay sellers often throw in the towel when their items don't sell right away. The 7-day auction is simply an arbitrary number of days to have a product for sale. Try 30-day listings for a few months and give buyers time to find your listing. The right buyer may not see your item in 7 days, so leave the item listed for a while. List a variety of different kinds of items. You will learn what kinds of items you like working with, and those you don't. It takes time to learn how and what to sell on eBay that is a good fit. Take your time and find what works for you."}
{"title": "Swedish Fish Flavored Oreos Selling on eBay for $18 a Box", "text": "It happens every time a well-known food product comes out with a weird or wacky flavor. eBay sellers buy a stockpile of a limited edition flavor and list it on eBay to see what the market will bear. In the past, it has happened with all kinds of limited edition flavored foods including:Pop TartsDunkin Donuts CoffeeM&Ms (notably, coconut M&Ms)Krusteaz Baking MixesAndes CandiesKeurig K-CupsPillsbury, Duncan Hines, and Betty Crocker Cake MixesCoffee Mate and International Delight coffee creamer (powdered)CerealWhy Swedish Fish Flavor?In the past, Nabisco has created some unusual Oreo combinations including banana split, birthday cake, candy corn, key lime pie, cotton candy, peppermint, rainbow sherbet, and mint. This time, it is Oreo's Swedish Fish flavored cookies. The chocolate cookie on the outside is the traditional Oreo, but the filling is red and Swedish Fish flavored. (Swedish Fish is a gummy type candy, similar to licorice.) This is definitely a bizarre combination. Business Insider reported on August 12, 2016:\"We know that consumers enjoy variety when it comes to snacking, so we create all of our limited-edition flavors to provide surprising new twists people know and love, and, on occasion, create unexpected and unique flavor combinations that people may never have thought were possible,\" an Oreo spokesperson stated.\"Why Do People Pay More than Retail for Limited Edition Foods?eBay is its own little universe. Actually, it is a huge universe, but the rules are different than in regular retail stores. When an item is limited in number, it becomes more valuable. This all goes back to the basic law of supply and demand:\"The law of supply states that the quantity of a good supplied (i.e., the amount owners or producers offer for sale) rises as the market price rises, and falls as the price falls. Conversely, the law of demand says that the quantity of a good demanded falls as the price rises, and vice versa.\" EconLib.OrgSellers have learned over the years to pay attention to limited edition food products and flip them on eBay for a profit. The first question many people unfamiliar with eBay ask about this phenomenon is: \"Why would someone pay more for something than the retail price?\"There are actually several reasons why people pay more than retail for something on eBay:It is not available in their geographic area. With the Swedish Fish Oreos, the Kroger family of supermarkets is the only store selling them. Plenty of buyers won't live near a Kroger or won't want to drive to one that is too far away just to buy a package of cookies.They are not price sensitive. Maybe someone just wants to try a bizarre or unusual food and says, \"What the heck!\" and orders it online. People pay big money to try a novelty item.They are buying the item as a gift. Nothing makes a more fun or memorable birthday or holiday gift than an unusual limited edition item. They don't want the hassle of finding the item locally. Have you ever been on a wild goose chase trying to find an item and every store you visit is out of stock? Or maybe you have 3 kids and don't want to haul them around while you search for an elusive item. Ordering online is quick, easy, and the item arrives at your door in a couple of days. For convenience, many shoppers choose to pay more for something online than to spend their valuable time tracking it down locally.Sell During the Optimal Time WindowHigh prices on limited edition items won't last. There is an optimal window to get the most bang for your buck. The perfect storm includes:A market that isn't saturated with too much of the itemTimeframe before the item expires (eBay does not allow listings for expired food)Competitive enough market where buyers will pay your priceIf you are thinking about running out to a Kroger and buying a bunch of Swedish Fish Oreos to sell, think long and hard about what you have to lose. Some of the eBay listings for these cookies show an expiration date of January 2017, so these may be a good seller for Christmas. Or, many other sellers may read this article and flood the market so the price will decline. While eBay shows completed listings for up to $18.50 a package plus shipping, this price won't last.Reviews for Swedish Fish OreosThe reviews for Swedish Fish Oreos aren't very good, so they may not be a hot seller like some of the other limited edition flavors. Reviews are always something to consider when selling a food product because you may spend money on inventory and it might not sell. While nothing is guaranteed in life, paying attention to reviews can save you money and prevent waste in your business. Here are a few reviews for this product: The Impulsive Buy: \"This creme isn\u2019t perfectly pillowy, soft, and squishy. It\u2019s a little more sticky, chewy, and dare I say\u2026slimy. It cracks and falls apart like a child\u2019s Play-Doh diorama of the Berlin Wall, and each Oreo I opened contained a different Rorschach test image in its pasty folds.\"  CBS Detroit: Quite frankly, these were way worse that I was imagining. The first cookie was OK, the second one was hard to choke down and I had to stop eating the third one. I even tried dipping one in milk, which made it slightly more edible but it was still hard to swallow. Thrillist: Taking a bite of the cookie, the Swedish Fish flavor wasn't front and center. I only got chocolate in the finish. And if I thought it smelled like cough syrup in my kitchen a minute ago, after I ate a cookie, I couldn't get the cough syrup taste out of my mouth.Bottom LineBased on the reviews, you might want to pass on this limited edition item. Oreos are usually $4 a package regular price and there is no guarantee they will sell for any price. You may be left with a stockpile of inedible cookies to give out as Christmas presents this year."}
{"title": "eBay Feedback Evaluation Percentage Quick Guide", "text": "eBay\u2019s feedback system is one of the central pillar\u2019s of eBay\u2019s business model. Because eBay is a forum for connecting buyers and sellers who have never met before and who may live on opposite ends of the earth, it\u2019s critically important for each party in the transaction to be able to evaluate the trustworthiness of their trading partner.But while the feedback system is relatively clear in theory, just how does it work in practice? What numbers are \u201cgood\u201d feedback numbers, and what numbers are \u201cbad\u201d feedback numbers? What things should you look for (or look out for) apart from numbers when evaluating the feedback of a potential trading partner?This guide is intended to make feedback evaluation quick and easy.Evaluating Feedback PercentageFeedback percentage is calculated as the total percentage of feedback transactions for the member that were rated positively. Feedback percentage is thus a good indicator of an eBay member\u2019s trustworthiness\u2014the likelihood that they are \"on the level\"\u2014that they are honest traders that intend to hold up their end of the bargain and that are capable of doing so.Here is a rough guide for evaluating feedback percentages. 100% Feedback Percentage: Perfect. This buyer/seller has no negative ratings thus far; no-one they have dealt with has been dissatisfied. 99.8% to 99.9% Feedback Percentage: Excellent. Only 1-2 of every 1,000 trading partners has been dissatisfied when dealing with this person. 99.4% to 99.7% Feedback Percentage: Very good. Only 3-6 of every 1,000 trading partners has been dissatisfied when dealing with this person. 99.0% to 99.3% Feedback Percentage: Good. As many as 1 in every 100 trading partners has been dissatisfied when dealing with this person. 98.0% to 98.9% Feedback Percentage: Fair. As many as 1 in every 50 trading partners has been dissatisfied when dealing with this person. 95.0% to 97.0% Feedback Percentage: Somewhat poor. As many as 1 in every 20 trading partners has been dissatisfied when dealing with this person. 90.0% to 96.0% Feedback Percentage: Poor. As many as 1 in every 10 trading partners has been dissatisfied when dealing with this person. Below 90.0% Feedback Percentage: Beware! More than 1 in every 10 trading partners has been dissatisfied when dealing with this person\u2014and your chances of being dissatisfied when trading with them are pretty good as well.In practice, it rarely pays to try to buy from sellers with a feedback percentages below 99.0% and you should do your utmost to find sellers with feedback percentages that are higher than this. By the same token, it rarely pays to keep bids from buyers with feedback percentages below 90.0% and you should do your utmost to watch your auctions and cancel such bids.Evaluating Feedback ScoreFeedback scores are calculated as the total of positive ratings from unique trading partners minus the total of negative ratings from unique trading partners. Feedback scores are therefore the primary indicator of an eBay member\u2019s level of experience as an online trader\u2014higher numbers mean more experience.Experience is important for several reasons. It means that the member in question will be more adept at solving problems as the arise. Experienced sellers, similarly, are more likely to be prompt in shipping, to pack items carefully, to deliver items that match their descriptions closely, and to be available for questions or communication. Experienced buyers are more likely to pay quickly and to provide clear shipping details and a correct address. They are also less likely to cancel bids.Here is a rough guide for evaluating feedback scores. 1000+ Feedback Score: Veteran trader. This eBay member has bought and/or sold a very large quantity of goods on eBay. They know what they are doing and likely know how to handle any problems that come up. They have also followed to rules over the long term\u2014at least long enough to have built up a score this high. 500-999 Feedback Score: Very experienced. This eBay member has bought and/or sold a very large quantity of goods on eBay and is likely to be able to follow through on all counts. 100-499 Feedback Score: Experienced. This eBay member has been trading long enough to have encountered most of the types of complications that arise when trading online, and are experienced enough to help inexperienced buyers/sellers along. 50-99 Feedback Score: Somewhat experienced. This eBay member is hitting their stride on eBay. They may not have traded as much as some, but they aren\u2019t clueless either. In most circumstances they will be on top of things, though complex issues may still present delays. 10-49 Feedback Score: Somewhat inexperienced. This eBay member isn\u2019t brand new, but they may not have had to face many of the common issues with shipping, payment, and communication that can arise in online trading. Best paired with an experienced trading partner. 0-9 Feedback Score: Inexperienced and/or new to eBay. This eBay member may be well-intentioned, but they will need help at every step of the transaction. They are unlikely to be fast in paying (if a buyer) and/or shipping (if a seller) and they are likely to make mistakes. They have also not traded long enough to demonstrate commitment to their trading partners under all conditions. Trade with patience and caution.In practice, only experienced traders should enter into transactions with anyone having a feedback score less than 10, and anyone with a feedback score less than 50 should give pause to anyone who isn\u2019t at least somewhat experienced.There are several other feedback factors to pay attention to when viewing buyer or seller feedback profiles. These aren\u2019t expressed as numbers in the same clear fashion, but can be very indicative of the type of experience you\u2019ll have nonetheless.eBay join date. Near the top of every feedback profile, just below the eBay member ID, you\u2019ll see the phrase \u201cMember since,\u201d followed by a date. This is the date on which the member in question first joined eBay. Give preference to traders who have been eBay members for a very long time\u2014it indicates that they follow the rules and keep their trading partners happy over time, and are committed to maintaining their eBay membership in good standing.Individual transaction comments. Every feedback rating, whether positive, negative, or neutral, is accompanied by a comment. Most positive comments are fairly uninformative but negative comments can tell you a lot about the types of problems you\u2019re likely to encounter with this trader. For example, repeated \u201cDid not pay after winning!\u201d negatives indicate that a buyer may be hesitant to pay for auctions that he or she has won, while repeated \u201cTook four weeks for item to arrive!\u201d negatives indicate that you may have a long wait ahead of you if you buy an item from a given seller.Responses to negatives. If the member has received negative feedback ratings, check the negative comments to see if the member in question has responded to them. Often this response can tell you a lot. A seller who responds with \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were dissatisfied\u2014please contact me!\u201d is likely to be much easier to work with in case of problems than a seller who responds to a negative with \u201cThis jerk gave me a frickin\u2019 negative! What an idiot!\u201dThe Big PictureThe feedback system is complicated and nuanced, and a large feedback profile can be a lot to take in. In the end, here\u2019s how you should go about putting it all together, in order.Look at the feedback percentage first. If the feedback percentage is too low, rule out the trading partner immediately\u2014there\u2019s no point looking any further.Look at the feedback score next. If the feedback percentage is high but the score is low, ask yourself whether you really want to deal with an inexperienced partner. If the feedback percentage is marginal but the score is low, rule them out\u2014no sense making trouble for yourself.Consider join date and reasons for negatives. If the feedback percentage and score leave you on the fence, consider the less concrete factors like join date and the reasons for negatives to see if you\u2019re comfortable trading with this person.Consider responses to negatives and any other factors. If you find all else to be ambiguous, consider anything else you see in the feedback profile\u2014like the responses to negatives, feedback left for others, frequency of trades, and so on\u2014to help you make your final decision.In the final analysis, follow your instincts when deciding whether to trade with someone or not. Don\u2019t talk yourself into trading with someone you really don\u2019t feel comfortable with simply because the price is right\u2014that\u2019s now more negatives get made."}
{"title": "Robin Roberts Bio", "text": "Current Media Position:Robin Roberts is co-anchor of ABC's .Significance to the Media Industry:Robin Roberts is credited with helping Good Morning America rise to compete with NBC's once-dominant Today show in the Nielsen ratings. She brings a unique background to the position.Roberts spent most of her career covering the competitive world of sports, not the softer, warm stories found on morning TV news. She was also a top athlete -- setting records as a women's basketball player when she was a student at Southeastern Louisiana University.But she's successfully made the transition to news. On Good Morning America, she's interviewed world leaders and reported on top health issues. Roberts even hosted a prime time special on country music from Nashville, Tennessee, and an Academy Awards preview special. She has forged a unique identity despite the sameness that often describes morning news programs.Robin Roberts' Early Career:Robin Roberts would easily earn the respect of anyone working in local television. That's because she also slowly climbed the ladder, rising from small DMA stations on her way to the network.Roberts first worked in radio while in college. Then she made the move to TV sports in 1983, working at WDAM in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and later for WLOX in Biloxi, Mississippi.Her first big station was WSMV in Nashville, where she won a \"Sportscaster of the Year\" award in 1987. Then it was off to the big leagues of Atlanta, Georgia, which has a full range of professional sports to cover. She anchored sports at WAGA, while also becoming a morning radio personality for a local station.That put Roberts in a prime spot for ESPN to notice her. She landed at the cable TV sports network in 1990.Because of the Disney ownership connection between ESPN and ABC, Roberts was able to work for ESPN while also contributing to Good Morning America. That started in 1995. Finally, in 2005, she was named co-anchor of Good Morning America, where she was already familiar and much admired.Career Highlights:Robin Roberts was dealt two very personal blows. Despite the difficulties she faced, they both have to be considered career highlights.In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit Mississippi, where she grew up, and Louisiana, where she went to college. Roberts' hometown of Pass Christian, Mississippi, was especially hard hit.While countless other journalists also rushed to the scene of the devastation, Roberts' coverage was much more personal because she knew the area and its people. Not only did she set up a campaign to rebuild Pass Christian, she's returned to the area to produce follow-up stories, long after other reporters had left.Her own health concerns have also made news, which have created a special bond with viewers. In 2007, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Instead of retreating from the public eye, she decided to stop wearing a wig on TV after she lost her hair. Her battle brought her much praise and several awards.In 2012, she announced that she was faced with a rare bone marrow disease. As with breast cancer, Roberts was very open with her health struggles. She underwent a bone marrow transplant and was off the air while undergoing treatment. She was able to return to TV five months after getting the transplant. Her televised medical journey, which raised awareness and encouraged people to join a bone marrow donor registry won a Peabody Award.Personal Information:Robin Roberts was born on November 23, 1960. She grew up in Pass Christian, Mississippi, as one of her parents' four children. Her father was a member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. A sister, Sally-Ann Roberts, is an anchor at WWL, the CBS affiliate in New Orleans.Roberts earned her degree in communications from Southeastern Louisiana University in 1983. Her achievements on the basketball court led the university to retire her jersey."}
{"title": "Explanation of Paycheck Deductions", "text": "The amount of money deposited in your bank account on payday is less than your salary or wages as a result of payroll deductions. In addition to taxes the law requires your employer to withhold from your paycheck, you may have optional deductions related to programs or benefits in which you enrolled or legal garnishments as a result of financial obligations. Some deductions reduce your taxable income; others have no affect on the taxes you pay. Understanding where your money goes and the deductions on your pay stub or statement is part of managing your finances. If you question an entry, ask your human resources department to confirm its accuracy.\n\nThree employees standing together.\n\ncredit: XiXinXing/XiXinXing/Getty Images\n\nUnavoidable Subtractions\n\nTaxes comprise the bulk of paycheck deductions. Your federal tax deduction is based on your earnings and the filing status and number of allowances you entered on the Form W-4 Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate you gave your employer. You also pay a percentage of your earnings toward two retirement-related taxes mandated by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act: Social Security and Medicare. If you live in a state that taxes income, a deduction for state tax is required. Regardless of your state's tax requirements, municipalities where you live and work may impose wage and local services taxes that you pay through payroll deductions.\n\nDeductions Before Taxes\n\nYou may have paycheck deductions if you save for your child's college costs or for your retirement through a program offered by your employer. Contributions to your profession's pension plan, a savings plan such as a 401(k), or a deferred compensation plan appear as line items on your pay statement. Your employer subtracts the total of these deductions from your gross income before calculating how much to withhold for income taxes. Child or dependent care, health benefit premiums and eligible commuter program deductions you elect reduce all mandated taxes, including Medicare and Social Security.\n\nPost-Tax Deductions\n\nYour employer may give you the opportunity to make charitable contributions and purchase insurance policies, savings bonds and recreational memberships through post-tax deductions. If your job is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, your pay statement has either a deduction for union dues or fair share contribution. These deductions, as well as any garnishments imposed to collect debts, child support or alimony by a government agency or court order, reduce your take-home pay, but not the amount withheld for local, state and federal taxes. Your employer subtracts them from your earnings after deducting retirement and tax payments and before your voluntary deductions.\n\nDeduction Accuracy\n\nMonitor your pay statements throughout the year so that any errors can be corrected immediately and you don't lose money. For example, any time you adjust your W-4 withholding, receive a raise or work additional hours, verify your pay reflects the change. Also, make sure your employer withholds taxes for the correct residence tax authority after you change addresses to avoid overpaying or underpaying local tax.\n\nYear-End Reconciliation\n\nThe information reported to the Internal Revenue Service on your W-2 corresponds to your final pay statement of the year. However, the taxable income shown on the W-2 differs from your gross earnings -- how much you made in total -- due to any pretax deductions you had. If you receive a 1099 form instead of a W-2 because you had income other than a salary, tips or wages, compare the earnings and taxes reported against your invoices, investment statements or receipts."}

{"title": "Are your debit card rewards safe?", "text": "It's no secret major banks are dropping or curtailing their popular debit card rewards programs. But what happens to the cash, airline miles, points and whatnot that consumers have already earned by swiping a debit or check card? Debit Cards Card rewards falling out of favor\nHang on to debit card rewards\nThe future of debit card rewards\nAre your debit card rewards safe?\nTrusty debit rewards replacements \u00ab See all guide content\nFor example at JPMorgan Chase, cash-back rewards have been deposited into customers' accounts, Continental Airlines and United Airlines miles have flowed into their airline mileage programs, and Ultimate Rewards points have been put into customers' accounts to be redeemed through a Chase website, says Tom Kelly, a Chase spokesman in Chicago. Customers who've earned Disney rewards need to convert those points to a Disney debit card. Chase also refunded an annual program fee to some customers on a pro rata basis when the program ended.\nAirline miles and other perks redeemed through outside-the-bank providers generally are transferred to customers' accounts on a regular basis. In keeping with that practice, banks are distributing these types of rewards and putting redemption in the customer's hands, so to speak. Cash awards generally work in a similar fashion.\nFor example, at Wells Fargo, points are forfeited if the checking account is closed, points expire five years after the month in which they were earned and a minimum of 650 points is required to qualify for any rewards, according to bank spokeswoman Lisa Westermann.\nTwo exceptions: If the checking account is closed, any unredeemed points likely will be gone while some points will be subject to expiration dates.\n\"We don't see anybody taking accumulated points away,\" Albright says. \"In most cases, you're allowed to redeem these points. It's just that they're not taking new enrollments. Over time, the points will peter out because nobody is getting any new ones.\"\nOrdinarily, those rewards won't vanish, even if the program is terminated, according to George Albright, vice chairman of Speer & Associates, a financial services consulting firm in Alpharetta, Ga.\nConsumers whose rewards can be redeemed through an online shopping mall operated for the bank by a fulfillment company might wonder whether the offerings in those malls will shrink as the volume of reward points dwindles. Albright says anything is possible, but that outcome seems unlikely since credit card rewards usually are redeemed through the same malls, and those programs are still active.\n\"A bank that has a big credit card portfolio is going to maintain those relationships because there are a lot of credit card points out there, and (consumers) will continue to accumulate them,\" he says. \"That's still a selling point for the credit card.\"\nThat said, individual merchants might exit particular debit card rewards programs, making those goods or services no longer an option. For that reason and to avoid the risk of forgetfulness, consumers are advised to utilize points sooner rather than later.\nFree checking, sans rewards\nSome banks still offer debit card rewards but typically not on free checking accounts. The reverse is also true. Free checking accounts still can be found but typically not with debit card rewards.\nEven without rewards, a debit or check card still can be used to access an ATM or make a purchase in person or online, offering greater convenience than cash or a paper check. What has changed is not so much the card itself as the \"value proposition\" of that card for the bank, consumer and merchant, Albright says.\n\"We're seeing a retrenchment in the card being the lead product. The checking account now becomes the lead product,\" he says. \"If (consumers) want a debit card, they can have a debit card. It's just going to be an access vehicle for the checking account.\"\nThe overall relationship between the bank and customer also comes into play as debit reward programs come to an end, Albright says. Generally, banks tend to offer wealthier customers greater access to a wider variety of fee waivers, rewards and other perks, based on their higher utilization of a bank's products and services.\nFor example at PNC Bank, customers can choose a checking account with no monthly service charge, no minimum balance requirement and no debit card rewards, or they can pick a checking account with rewards and a monthly fee that is waived if certain activity or balance requirements are met, according to PNC. The idea, from the bank's point of view, is to keep customers who need only a basic checking account while encouraging them to expand their banking relationship and transition to a higher-value account.\nBanks also have stepped up their promotions of credit cards that offer rewards. Consumers who pay off the balance every month stand to gain. Those who carry a balance should remember that any use of that credit card racks up interest charges as well as rewards.\n\u00ab Back to Debit Cards."}
{"title": "Has Your Real Estate Listing Expired?", "text": "Sellers find it difficult to be optimistic after a listing has expired. Most are excited and nervous when that listing agreement is first signed, hoping that the home sells quickly and for a big profit. It's frustrating to wait week after week for a purchase offer when that offer never arrives.Regardless of the length of listing -- whether the agreement was for a term of 90 days, 180 days or a year -- when the listing has expired, the broker / seller relationship has come to an end (more or less). This is when sellers often ask whose fault is it that the home isn't selling?Check MotivationThe first step is to review your reasons to sell. If you don't fit one of the 15 reasons listed, then you might want to revisit why you are selling. In other words, maybe you don't have a reason to sell. Perhaps you should temporarily take your home off the market.If you are not motivated to sell, you are not a seller. You're a home owner with a sign in the yard. Without motivation, you've got about as much hope for selling as an owner with a sign that reads, \"Keep Off the Grass.\"Review MarketingWhere is the business plan to sell your home? Review the marketing plan with your agent, step-by-step. Did your agent drop the ball? Did you? What worked, what didn't pull ad calls or showings? Did you do a virtual tour, send out direct mail, put a lockbox on the property?Consider ConditionGo out and look at other homes on the market to determine if your home is in the same condition as those actively for sale. Perhaps you need to do repairs before selling. Maybe your home needs to be staged. Does your home scream curb appeal? Have you followed the top 10 home showing tips?Look Again at Buyer ObjectionsWhat have buyers said about your home? Review buyer feedback, which your agent should have obtained for you when your home first went on the market. Is there validity to what buyers were saying? How can you compensate for those objections?Discount Sudden ActivityYou won't have to look too far to find agents because they'll all come crawling out of the woodwork when your listing expires. Realtors are prevented from soliciting a seller when the listing is active in MLS. But you're fair game when the listing has expired.You may wonder why your listing, now that it has expired, is so popular. Many agents specialize in contacting expired listings because they want the listing. Period. Moreover, realize that some agents will take an overpriced listing just to get signage.You might ask your agent to make sure your name and phone number have been removed from MLS when the listing is withdrawn, canceled or expired to make it more difficult for agents to harass, oops, I mean, call you.Contact Several Listing AgentsInterview agents. Ask the hard questions to determine if the agents are giving you the right answers. Find out what another agent might do differently. If another agent offers substantially more service than your existing agent, list with that agent. Check your criteria for choosing a listing agent.Talk to Your Existing Agent About Why the Listing ExpiredIf your agent has fulfilled the marketing plan, worked diligently to sell your home, and the market is not answering the ring to your dinner bell, then you might need to conform to the market. This means a price reduction. Ask your existing agent to prepare another comparative market analysis to determine if your home is priced to sell.If you respect and value your agent, relist with that agent. Adjust your price accordingly and follow your agent's suggestions, even if it means making repairs or improvements you'd rather not do. If your agent is spending money on your listing through advertising, aggressive marketing and networking that listing, that agent deserves your loyalty.At the time of writing, Elizabeth Weintraub, DRE # 00697006, is a Broker-Associate at Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, California."}

{"title": "6 Things to Think About Before Choosing a Retirement Age", "text": "The earliest age you can collect your Social Security retirement benefits is age 62 - but just because you can collect at this age doesn't mean you should. You'll get a larger monthly amount by claiming at a later age. In addition, if you take Social Security at 62, or any time before full retirement age (which varies by your date of birth), and you continue to work and earn an amount in excess of the earnings limit, your Social Security benefits will be reduced. Don't start collecting your Social Security benefits until you understand how your start age affects your benefits. Married couples in particular need to do careful planning as they can often get an increased survivor benefit when they coordinate when and how they each begin their benefits.You may be eligible to withdraw money from your 401(k) plan as early as age 55. Different rules apply to distributions you take at different ages. Key 401(k) retirement ages to be aware of are: 55, 59 1/2, and age 70 1/2. If you are not yet age 55 and you need to access your 401(k) money, you might be able to use a 401(k) loan, or take a hardship withdrawal, however be cautious of early withdrawals. There is creditor protection provided to money in a 401(k) plan, so you need to think twice before you cash out of your plan.The U.S. Census Bureau tells us the average retirement age in the United States is 62, and the average length of retirement is 18 years. Interestingly enough, Social Security defines 62 as your early retirement age; begin benefits at this age and you will receive a reduced Social Security benefit. Those who have pensions, a large amount of savings and the ability to maintain a budget, will likely be in good shape if they choose to retire at age 62 or earlier. Those who don't have those things need to consider working past the average retirement age.Many Americans think of age 55 or earlier as an early retirement age. If you can save enough early on in life, early retirement is achievable. Early retirement is most common for those who are either extreme savers or who started work early in the military or in some form of civil service (which means they are eligible for a pension at a young age). My definition of early retirement age is any age before 65. For those without pensions, rather than retiring early, consider finding work you love to do. Many people use early retirement from one job as an opportunity to find a second career that they truly enjoy.The official age of retirement and effective age of retirement are two different things, and they vary from country to country. The official age of retirement would be the age at which government retirement benefits kick in. The effective age would the the age people choose to retire, even if benefits are not yet available. Interestingly enough, some countries have much lower effective retirement ages than others.This retirement age timeline tells you what retirement planning events are triggered at specific ages, and what you need to do as you near each age. The key ages are 55, 59 1/2, 62, 65, 70, 70 1/2, and 75. Before you choose your retirement age you will need to become familiar with the rules.

From teleconference services and online payment services, to open-source software and remote desktop applications, there are many ways you can reduce business costs with technology.Traditional telephone lines can be an expensive and sometimes unnecessary business cost. Small business owners who opt to use cell phones, VoIP and virtual phone lines instead of a traditional landline can reduce their business costs.The cost of paper, ink, mailing supplies and postage may seem minimal at times, but it can add up to a large business expense. Going paperless by not printing unless absolutely necessary, transitioning to a digital invoice and bill payment system, and filing all important paperwork on your computer instead of a file cabinet can help you reduce some of the most common recurring business costs.If you have yet to jump on the Internet marketing bandwagon, you are missing the potential of fast-paced, high-result, low-cost marketing. You can start with a business blog, social media marketing, or other online advertising and have the potential to see a relatively quick response with very minimal business costs.You may be able to reduce your immediate business costs by charging business expenses to your business credit card, but with interest rates and possible fees, this is not an effective way to reduce your business costs long term. Reducing your credit card debt is not a quick and easy way to reduce your business costs, but it's a smart way to make your business more financially healthy over the long term.Budgeting goes hand-in-hand with reduced business costs because it's impossible to make smart financial decisions without a clear idea of the money you have coming in and going out of your business every month. A business budget that you use daily can become a powerful tool for reducing your business costs effectively.The expenses that come with having a physical place of business can be immense, and in many cases, this is unavoidable. If you are in a situation that can change, however, you may be able to reduce your business costs dramatically by downsizing your retail location, exploring a coworking arrangement, or even converting your business to a home-based business and having employees telecommute.How many applications do you use every day? There are probably a few applications you have on your computer right now that you have never used or very rarely use. You can reduce your business costs by only purchasing the software you really need and avoiding the cost of purchasing other apps, plus any upgrade fees necessary to keep the software current. Open-source software alternatives to brand name applications are also an effective way to reduce your business costs.Buying brand new, retail-priced equipment is a big business cost. You can reduce the expense by buying refurbished furniture and equipment that is often as good as the brand new variety but offered by manufacturers at a discounted price.Bartering is an exchange of your good and services for good and services you need without any cash changing hands. When a successful bartering arrangement is reached, you can reduce your business costs by avoiding the initial outlay of funds in order to fill an immediate need.Each of these 10 ways to reduce business costs focuses on making an alternate decision that can save you money. If you are able to adopt a \"business cost friendly\" mindset, many of these smart decisions will become second nature and eventually work their way into all of your business decisions, helping you reduce your business costs every day."}

Many investors would like to retire sooner rather than later, and if you have the financial resources, you can retire at any age.\n\nSocial Security Administration\n\nTo some, getting your retirement refers to getting Social Security benefits. In fact, 96 percent of U.S. workers are covered under Social Security. You must have at least 40 credits with 10 years of work to qualify for benefits. The earliest age to get Social Security retirement benefits is 62, but you have to wait until you're 67 to get a full retirement benefit.\n\nPension Income\n\nPension benefits are established by your employer. Your benefits may be reduced depending on how many years you worked for that company. Most pensions are paid beginning at 55, although the benefit is reduced. You get the full benefit at 65. Those who work in the public sector may have Social Security benefits reduced by pension benefit amounts.\n\nQualified Retirement Plans\n\nQualified retirement plans such as IRAs and 401(k) plans are supplemental retirement income sources with tax benefits. But the IRS expects you to hold money in these accounts until age 59 1/2. Early distributions are penalized 10 percent plus added to income. There is a way to access these plans without penalty and retire early with a consistent income.

Like 401(k) plans, 403b plans accumulate funds on a tax-assisted basis through salary reductions and employer contributions. As long as employees leave the organization after age 50 and maintain the 403b with the plan administrator, the IRS allows distributions to start at age 55."}

{"title": "How to Wow the Judges in Halloween Costume Contests", "text": "When Halloween rolls around each year, you have ample opportunity to win prizes for your costumes through online costume contests, contests hosted by local businesses, and even friends' parties. If you'd like to take the prize this year, follow these five easy steps to learn how to win Halloween costume contests.Winning Costume Contests Step 1: Read the Rules. Carefully.When you hear about a Halloween costume contest that you want to enter, your first instinct might be to start brainstorming ideas right away. But hold on a minute; before you start thinking about costumes and props, read through the contest's rules thoroughly. Maybe even more than once.It doesn't matter how great your Halloween costume is if you get disqualified from the contest on a technicality. So jot down guidelines for entry, the goal of the contest, the end date, and other pertinent details to make sure that your entry will be accepted.While you're at it, also think about the costume contest's sponsor. You may have a leg-up on the competition if your contest entry ties into the sponsor's product or image.Winning Costume Contests Step 2: Come Up with a Great CostumeYou're not going to win a Halloween costume contest with the same costume everyone else is wearing. Pick a costume that's original and reflects your personality.Cute or funny costumes have an advantage over costumes that are gruesome (unless the contest is looking for something scary) since people tend to have a positive feeling toward them. Avoid the standard fare (witches and vampires) or current costume trends unless you can add a personal twist.In photos, you can use props along with the costume to make your image more eye-catching.If you're looking for some inspiration for original Halloween costumes, Pinterest has over 1,000 images to browse through. You can also pull inspiration from stories in the news, popular movies, or word play (like this one for chicken cord on blue).Winning Costume Contests Step 3: Make Your Halloween Costume Contest Entry Stand OutWhether you're entering Halloween costume contests online with a photo or video entry, or you're standing before the judges in a local costume contest, one sure-fire way to stand out from the competition is to really play the role that your costume represents.For example, look at the photograph above; it wouldn't be nearly as arresting if the angel were looking straight into the camera and smiling blandly. It's the truly angelic expression on her face that would make any judge take a second look, even though the costume itself is very simple.Coming up with a little background for a character that matches your costume might help you bring some personality to your costume. Don't be just \"an angel\" or \"a superhero.\" Come up with a name, consider what would be important to your character, and bring that personality onto the stage or into the photo or video you take.For more tips, see How to Create a Believable Character.Winning Costume Contests Step 4: Take a Great Picture of Your ContestMany costume contests, especially those that take place online, base their judging on a photo of your Halloween costume. Even if you have a unique Halloween costume idea and have and have made it stand out with your personality, you need to take an amazing photograph to have a chance to win.Judges will be looking at hundreds of photographs, so yours needs to stand out be able to stand out from the crowd. If appropriate, use props to make your costume really pop. Use good lighting to highlight the subject's expression as well as the costume details. And try some unique camera angles so that you won't just be another person staring straight into the camera.For some ideas about taking unique, great-looking photos for your costume contest, read how to win photography contests.Winning Costume Contests Step 5: Build Enthusiasm for Your Halloween Costume Contest EntryAt this point, you've created a unique and fantastic Halloween costume, you've come up with a way to set it apart from the crowd, and you've taken a fantastic picture to submit to the contest (if necessary). Is there anything else you can do to help you win your Halloween costume contest?For many contests, there is one final step: gathering votes for your entry.If your local costume contest asks for input from the crowd when picking a winner, make sure that you work the room, talking to people and letting them get to know you and see your costume.If you're entering an online costume contest, read 50+ ideas to get votes for online contests and how to get votes on Facebook for ways to entice people to vote for your costume."}

But when you're self-employed, you don't have the option of a traditional 401k. Limits on certain investment retirement accounts (IRAs) can also make it difficult to build up a large nest egg, so you may be considering opening a Simplified Employee Pension, or SEP IRA, which allows you to save more. You can contribute to both a SEP and a Roth IRA if you are self-employed.The Roth IRA is funded by individuals using after-tax dollars. You simply set up an account in your own name and fund it. The SEP IRA, on the other hand, is primarily funded by an employer. As a self-employed person, you are both employer and employee and can set this up in your name, funding it as an employer. You are also allowed to make contributions to your SEP as an employee, but this is subject to the yearly limits.Employers are allowed to contribute the lesser of 25 percent of an employees salary, or $49,000 as of 2011. As a self-employed person, you can figure your salary either as a wage that you actually pay yourself, or as your profits after paying all expenses. As an individual, you can contribute a maximum of $5,000 to all IRA accounts combined, which you could divide between a SEP and Roth IRA, if you desire.Contributions to all IRAs cannot exceed $5,000 ($6,000 if 50 or older) or your earned income, whichever is less. This can include SEP, traditional or Roth IRAs. For example, you could put $5,000 in a Roth IRA only, or $2,500 in a traditional and $2,500 in a ROTH, as long as the total amount contributed to all of your IRAs does not exceed $5,000 a year.If you can afford to do so, you may want to look at investing in both types of IRAs. The Roth IRA offers tax advantages that allows you will withdraw your money tax-free when you retire, however, the SEP IRA allows you to put away a lot more money in tax-advantaged accounts."}

{"title": "How to Consolidate Debt With ABSA", "text": "Being in debt can be frustrating and scary. When you don't have enough money to pay bills or make necessary purchases, the last thing you want is creditors ringing your phone and making you even more anxious. There are many debt consolidation companies but sometimes it's hard to tell which ones are genuine and which ones are scams. ABSA is a renowned bank that offers modification of home and personal loan debt that will help you get your finances under control.\n\nStep\n\nKnow the facts. Understand what you are agreeing to by selecting a ABSA home or personal loan debt consolidation. With these types of loan consolidations, you combine all of your debt, which makes it easier because you only have to make one payment each month. This will help in reducing the monthly payment and also decrease the amount you are paying in interest on your various debts. However, because you are consolidating your debt into one loan, you will be paying it out over a longer period so you might actually pay more interest altogether.\n\nStep\n\nEvaluate your credit. After you have decided this is the right program for you, you need to check your credit score. Various websites offer free or low-cost credit reports. For example, try Equifax or freecreditreport.com. You need to review this to make sure there are no discrepancies on the report that you need to clear up before applying. ABSA typically requires credit ratings in the range of 700 and above to be approved for its home loan and personal consolidation programs, however this varies depending on an applicant's credit and work history (see Resources).\n\nStep\n\nStart the process. You will either need to apply to ABSA to transfer your existing home or personal loan from your current banking institution or you will need to increase your existing loan if you already have it with ABSA. This can be done quickly and easily online, or you can visit one of the bank's branches. It is recommended to complete the application online because it involves less paperwork, you can do it from home and you will usually receive a response much more quickly.\n\nStep\n\nEvaluate the offer. After much nail-biting, you finally receive notification that you were approved for a loan debt consolidation. Before you agree, make sure the lump sum monthly payment will be less than what you are currently paying to creditors. Compare every detail down to the interest rate to make sure you are coming out ahead. ABSA will then take your monthly payment and use it to pay your creditors through a deal they have worked out with them.\n\nStep\n\nBe proactive. Now it is up to you to make the monthly payments on time to improve your credit score and reduce your total debt. While this is a great solution to consolidate many debts into one payment, you also risk losing your home if you default on payment. You can usually miss one or two payments on a credit card with just a slap on the wrist and a late fee. However, defaulting on a home or personal loan can have much more serious consequences."}

However, Roboform doesn't work with Flash sweepstakes, which means that I had to hand-type all of my information into Flash forms.However, I read about a new software program called Texter. Texter is, according to its website, a program that \"lets you define text substitution hotstrings that, when triggered, will replace hotstring with a larger piece of text.\"In other words, instead of typing out my entire name, email address, or other information, I can just define a couple of characters and Texter will write out the whole thing for me. For example, I've set up the string \"swem\" followed by the tab character to insert my sweepstakes email into a form. Best of all, Texter works with any entry form, even Flash sweepstakes.At first, I wasn't sure if Texter would work out for me because it seemed to make some weird changes as I typed. Considering that speed and accuracy are very important to me, I didn't like being slowed down and having my words automatically changed. However, it turns out that this was a feature, not a bug. Apparently Texter can automatically correct spelling errors, which didn't work out for me. Luckily, the feature can be disabled in the preferences menu, and since then I have really enjoyed using it to speed up my sweepstakes entry.It would be possible to use this program in place of Roboform, but I think that Robo's one-click entry is faster. However, as a supplement when Roboform doesn't work, it's a really great tool for sweepstakes entry.

{"title": "The Beginner&#39;s Guide to S Corporation Accounting", "text": "S-Corporations need to maintain accurate and meticulous records of income, expenses, and capital investments. Overall, the S-Corporation reports total income and expenses at the company level, and passes-through a share of net profit or loss to individual shareholders. The S-Corporation needs to maintain excellent records regarding each shareholder's investment of cash or property. These records are crucial for establishing each shareholder's percentage of ownership in the company.Accounting for Income and ExpensesGenerally, S-Corporation accounting is the same as C-Corporation accounting. Income and expenses are reported at the corporate level, and the nature of various types of income and expense are identified at the corporate level as well. S-Corporations can choose an accounting method best suited to report the income and expenses of the company. S-Corporations are not required to use the accrual method of accounting; they may choose the cash method or a hybrid method of accounting if those methods of accounting.Income and expense items retain their character when they are passed-through to S-corporation shareholders. Long-term capital gains, for example, earned by the S-corporation are passed through as long-term capital gains to shareholders. S-Corporations therefore need to identify types of income and types of expenses for the benefit of their shareholders.Accounting for Shareholder CapitalThe biggest problem by far is accounting for the capital accounts of each and every single shareholder. The company must maintain meticulous records of each shareholder's equity investments of cash and property, as well as any loans that each shareholder advances to the company.Unlike limited partnerships and limited liability companies, shareholders of S-corporations must divide the corporation's net income in strict proportion to their share of ownership. If a shareholder has contributed exactly one-third of the company's capital, then exactly one-third of the company's net profit or loss must be allocated to that shareholder.The capital accounts come into play in two crucial parts of an S-Corporation's financial and tax reporting. First, the capital accounts are reported on the company's balance sheets as shareholder equity and loans from shareholders. Second, each shareholder's capital account can be summarized on Form 1120S Schedule K-1. Insufficient capital investments can cause shareholders to fail to meet the At-Risk rules for losses and can cause business losses to become non-deductible.Investing Cash and PropertyShareholders can invest cash or property to an S-Corporation. A shareholder might contribute a computer, desk, reference books, and software programs to her newly formed S-Corporation in addition to her cash investment. The value of the shareholder's property is the lower of (a) the fair market value of the property, or (b) the shareholder's adjusted basis in the property. (More information: Donating Property to an S-Corporation.)Shareholder Basis, Adjusted Basis, and Loan BasisA shareholder's capital account needs to reflect the shareholder's investments and current basis in the S-Corporation's equity or liabilities. A shareholder is invested in the S-Corporation to the extent that a shareholder has made an equity investment or advanced a loan to the company.Shareholder's Equity is reflected in the shareholder's capital account. This account should show the dollar amount of cash investments, and value of property donated to the company. A shareholder who contributed cash of $10,000, a computer worth $2,000, and software worth $400 would have a capital account showing a total investment of $12,400.The capital account is adjusted from time to time to reflect additional equity investments. Additionally, the capital account is adjusted at the end of the year to reflect each shareholder's pro-rata share of income and expenses.The adjusted basis of a shareholder's stock is calculated as follows:Adjusted basis at the beginning of the year+ Share of all income items that are separately stated, including tax-exempt income+ Share of all non-separately stated income items+ Share of deduction for excess depletion of oil & gas properties- Distribution of cash or property to the shareholder that was not included in the shareholder's wages- Share of all loss and deduction items that are separately stated, including Section 179 deductions and capital losses- Share of all non-separately stated losses- Share of non-deductible expenses, such as the non-deductible portion of meals & entertainment expense or non-deductible fines and penalties- Share of depletion for oil & gas properties not in excess of the property's basis.= Adjusted basis in S-Corporation stock at the end of the yearNext: Accounting for Loan Basis, Negative Basis, Restoring Basis, At Risk Rules, & Passive Activity Losses.Loan BasisShareholder may advance money to the S-Corporation as a loan. A common example is a shareholder that pays for company expenses using his personal credit card, and submits an expense report to the company for repayment. Loans to the company may be short-term loans (to be repaid in one year or less) or long-term loans (to be repaid in more than one year). Shareholder's making loans to their S-Corporation may take a tax deduction in the current year for losses in excess of their stock basis, but only to the extent they have loan basis.Loan basis, and adjusted loan basis, is calculated as follows:Initial amount loaned to the company + Additional amounts loaned to the company + Deferred interest that is capitalized (added to the loan) instead being repaid - Amount of loan principal repaid - Amount of loan principal forgiven by the shareholder - Amount of loan principal converted to stock - Share of net loss in excess of shareholder's adjusted stock basis = Adjusted basis in S-Corporation debt at the end of the year.Negative Basis and Suspended LossesAdjusted basis cannot be below zero. However, using the formula above for calculating adjusted basis will often result in a negative number. Here are the rules for handling \"negative basis\" of S-Corporation stock:Shareholder's stock basis is reduced, but not below zero, Then Shareholder's loan basis is reduced, but not below zero.Any excess \"negative basis\" is treated as a non-deductible loss. This excess loss is a \"suspended loss\" and carries over to future years indefinitely. The suspended loss may be deducted in any future tax year during which the shareholder has restored her loan basis or stock basis.If the shareholder had both an equity investment and advanced a loan to the company, then in following years the shareholder must restore her loan basis before restoring her stock basis.Restoring BasisShareholders may restore their stock basis or loan basis in several ways. The easiest way to restore basis is to make additional cash investments (to restore stock basis) or to advance additional cash loans (to restore loan basis).Adjusted stock basis and loan basis should be calculated tentatively just before the end of the year. This will give shareholders sufficient time to make additional loans or equity investments to ensure that any losses are fully tax-deductible.At-Risk RulesEach shareholder has an amount at risk. This is the amount of money the shareholder stands to lose from her investments or loans to the company. A shareholder's amount at risk is calculated as follows:Adjusted Stock Basis + Adjusted Loan Basis = Amount At Risk.Any loss in excess of the amount at risk is a \"suspended loss\" and follows the rules for suspended losses outlined above.Each shareholder's stock basis and loan basis will be adjusted for her pro-rata share of losses even if those losses are suspended because of the at-risk rules. It is therefore very important for the S-Corporation and its shareholders to track adjusted stock basis and adjusted loan basis accurately and meticulously.Passive Activity LossesS-Corporation shareholders are subject to the passive activity rules. These rules govern to what extent an S-Corporation loss is currently deductible by a shareholder.If the S-Corporation is engaged in the rental property business, then shareholders must meet the stringent \"active participation\" tests for real estate professionals in order to deduct rental losses in full. If a shareholder cannot meet the active participation tests for real estate professionals, then S-Corporation rental losses are deductible only to the extent the shareholder has passive activity income.If the S-Corporation is engaged in any business but the shareholder does not actively participate in the S-Corporation's business, then S-Corporation losses are deductible only to the extent the shareholder has passive activity income.Passive activity income includes passive income from S-Corporations, partnerships, trusts, interest, dividends, and other investment income.Previous: Accounting for Income, Expenses, Shareholder Equity, Converted Property, Adjusted Stock Basis."}
{"title": "After Fed Rate Hike, Mortgage Rates Move Slightly Higher", "text": "Everyone\u2019s talking about the Federal Reserve\u2019s short-term rate hike, the first since 2006, and its impact on home buying. But mortgage rates have ticked only a little higher in the past week.\nFreddie Mac\u2019s just-released weekly survey of lenders shows the following average rates for the most popular home loan terms:\n30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.97% with an average 0.6 point for the week ending Dec. 17, 2015. A year ago, the rate averaged 3.8%.\naveraged 3.97% with an average 0.6 point for the week ending Dec. 17, 2015.

The same term priced at 3.09% a year ago. 5-year adjustable-rate mortgages priced at 3.03% with an average 0.4 point. Last year at this time, the same ARM averaged 2.95%.\nCompare mortgage rates now\n\u201cWe take the Fed at its word that monetary tightening in 2016 will be gradual, and we expect only a modest increase in longer-term rates. Mortgage rates will tick higher but remain at historically low levels in 2016,\u201d Sean Becketti, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said in a release. \u201cHome sales will remain strong, but refinance activity should cool somewhat. Novel policy approaches such as quantitative easing injected significant liquidity in the economy over the past seven years. As a result, the Fed is forced to employ some new tools, such as reverse repos, as it tightens monetary policy. We are likely to see some short-term volatility in fixed-income markets as market participants adjust to these new tools.\u201d\nMortgage applications are also down slightly, decreasing 1.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s weekly report.\nOne area that\u2019s seeing an uptick in activity is refinancing, which increased to 60.7% of total mortgage applications from 58.7% the previous week, according to the MBA\u2019s survey. The adjustable-rate mortgage share of activity decreased to 6% of total applications.\nHousing data shows promising signs for 2016\nThe Fed\u2019s move to hike short-term interest rates by 0.25% doesn\u2019t mean that long-term rates \u2014 like mortgage interest rates \u2014 will immediately rise. But they will eventually, and economic and housing data suggest that the market is ready for it.\nNew construction, for example, is showing promising signs going into 2016. Nationwide housing starts rose 10.5%, or 1.173 million units, in November, according to data released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Commerce Department. Single-family production increased 7.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 768,000 units, its highest reading since January 2008.\n\u201cSingle-family production this month has reached levels last seen before the Great Recession, an indicator that we are making gradual headway back to a normal housing market,\u201d David Crowe, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said in a release. \u201cAs we close out the year, we can see that the housing sector has made headway in 2015, and we expect the recovery to continue at a modest pace.\u201d\nThe Fed\u2019s rate hike and the gradual rise in mortgage rates will likely bring a gradual return to stabilized home prices, especially in hot markets such as Denver, Dallas, and Raleigh, North Carolina.\nAnother promising sign is the fact that young renters still want to own a home, according to the National Association of Realtors\u2019 new quarterly household survey. What\u2019s more, an increasing share of the households surveyed believe their personal financial situation will improve in the months ahead, the survey found.\nThe optimism is tempered slightly by the fact that Americans are still concerned about the country\u2019s economic recovery. Only half of the survey\u2019s respondents believe the economy is currently improving, and 45% think the economy is actually in a recession."}
{"title": "What Has Obama Done? 11 Major Accomplishments", "text": "President Barack Obama entered office fighting the 2008 financial crisis. He immediately launched the ambitious Affordable Care Act, despite backlash. His administration continued battling the Tea Party Republicans after they gained Congressional majority in the 2010 mid-term elections. Despite these challenges, he accomplished many great things. Here are the top eleven. Find out how they match up to the 2008 \"Yes We Can!\" campaign promises.  1. Ended the 2008 RecessionIn February 2009, Congress approved Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package. It cut taxes, extended unemployment benefits, and funded public works projects. The recession ended in July when GDP growth turned positive. In just seven months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act pumped $241.9 billion into the economy. That increased growth to a robust 3.9 percent rate by early 2010. By March 30, 2011, almost all ($633.5 billion) of the funds were spent. Obama bailed out the U.S. auto industry on March 30, 2009. The Federal government took over General Motors and Chrysler, saving three million jobs. It forced the companies to become more fuel efficient and therefore more globally competitive.2. Received 2009 Nobel Peace PrizeOn October 9, 2009, Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize. The Committee lauded \"his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"  He withdrew troops from Iraq in 2011. He reduced the U.S. nuclear warhead stockpile by 10 percent. (Source: \"Inspires Hope for a Better Future,\" Nobel Prize.)3. Reformed Health CareOn March 23, 2010, Obamacare revolutionized healthcare. Why did healthcare need to be reformed? Rising costs threatened to outstrip Medicare's ability to pay for it, and contributed to 50 percent of all bankruptcies. The quality of care was one of the worst in the world. By 2014, the economy benefited from having 95 percent of the population on health insurance. The greater number of people receiving preventive care reduced the number of expensive visits to emergency rooms. For more, see Obamacare Pros and Cons.4. Regulated the Big BanksIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act improved regulation of eight areas that led to the financial crisis. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency reduced harmful practices of credit cards and mortgages. The Financial Stability Oversight Council regulated hedge funds and banks that became too big to fail. The \"Volcker Rule\" banned banks from risking losses with their depositors' money. Dodd-Frank clarified which agencies regulated which banks, stopping banks from cherry-picking their regulators.Dodd-Frank directed the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These regulated the riskiest derivatives, like credit default swaps and commodities futures. Dodd-Frank also asked the SEC to recommend how the credit rating agencies, like Moody's and Standard & Poor's, could be improved. 5. 2010 Tax CutsIn December 2010, Obama and Congress agreed upon additional stimulus in the form of an $858 billion tax cut. It had three main components: a $350 billion extension of the Bush tax cuts, a $56 billion extension of unemployment benefits, and a $120 billion reduction in workers' payroll taxes. Businesses received $140 billion in tax cuts for capital improvements and $80 billion in research and development tax credits. The estate tax was exempted (up to $5 million), and there were additional credits for college tuition and children. For more, see Obama Tax Cuts.6. Eliminated bin Laden Threat and Withdrew Troops from Iraq and Afghanistan WarsOn May 1, 2011, Navy SEALs attacked the al-Qaida leader's compound in Pakistan and eliminated Osama bin Laden. Later that year, Obama withdrew troops from the Iraq War. Three years later, renewed threats from ISIS meant troops had to return. For more, see Will It Ever End? How the Sunni-Shiite Split Affects the U.S. Economy. In 2014, Obama wound down the war in Afghanistan. Ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should have reduced annual military spending. At over $800 billion, it was the largest discretionary budget item and one of the leading causes of the budget deficit and national debt. Instead, military spending remained higher than during the Bush Administration. For more, see War on Terror Costs.7. Won 2012 Presidential Re-electionObama won a second term as president on November 6, 2012.  Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney promised to repeal Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. Voters were not sure about eliminating health benefits and regulations against big banks. Romney failed to capture the country's imagination by not presenting a new vision for economic growth.    8. Nuclear Agreement With IranOn July 14, 2015, Obama brokered a nuclear peace agreement with Iran. In return, the United Nations lifted the economic sanctions it imposed in 2010.  For details, see Iran's Economy: Impact of Nuclear Deal and Sanctions.9. World's Largest Trade AgreementOn October 4, 2015, Obama's team negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If ratified by Congress, it would have replaced NAFTA as the world's largest free-trade agreement. It would have removed tariffs between the United States and 11 other countries that border the Pacific Ocean.Obama launched the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the United States and the European Union. His term ended before negotiations could be finalized. It would have been bigger than the TPP. 10. International Climate Change AgreementObama led global efforts to finalize the International Climate Agreement. It was negotiated in Paris on December 12, 2015. Countries agreed to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon trading. Members decided to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. Developed countries will contribute $100 billion a year to assist emerging markets. Many developing countries bear the brunt of damage from climate change, facing typhoons, rising sea levels, and droughts.At least 55 of the 196 participating countries must now ratify the agreement before it can go into effect. At the 2016 G20 meeting, China and the United States agreed to ratify the agreement. These two countries are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases. (Source: \"Climate Agreement Best Chance We Have to Save the Planet,\" CNN, December 14, 2015.) Obama announced carbon reduction regulations in 2014. He enacted the Clean Power Plan in 2015. It reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It does this by setting carbon reduction goals for the nation's power plants. To comply, power plants will create 30 percent more renewable energy generation by 2030. It encourages carbon emissions trading by allowing states that emit less than the caps to trade their surplus to states that emit more than the cap.  (Source: \"Obama Just Created a Carbon Cap and Trade Program,\" Climate Central, August 4, 2015. \"President Obama to Announce Historic Carbon Pollution Standards for Power Plants,\" The White House, August 3, 2015.)11. Best Job CreatorObama is the biggest job-creating President in U.S. history. His policies put 22.309 million people to work from the depths of the recession in January 2010 to the end of his term. That's because unemployment continued to rise even after the recession ended in 2009. It takes a few months of economic growth before businesses are confident enough to begin hiring again.Since the beginning of his term, he put 17.267 million people to work. That makes him the second best job-creator, following Bill Clinton. Job gains would have been even better if Congress had approved Obama's proposed Americans Jobs Act. For more, see Job Creation by President.  Other AccomplishmentsMaintained Continuation of Federal Reserve Policy - Obama appointed Federal Reserve Vice-Chair Janet Yellen to replace Ben Bernanke. She maintained an expansionary monetary policy that created the lowest interest rates in 200 years. This allowed the early stages of the housing recovery and slow but steady business expansion to continue. For more, see Relationship Between Treasury Notes and Mortgage Rates.Deficit Spending - The major mark against Obama is the increase in the national debt. Part of the reason for this increase was the deficit spending he used to stimulate the economy. Deficits fell in his second term. Obama's total projected deficits are $6.576 trillion. FY 2017: $441 billion FY 2016: $600 billion FY 2015: $438 billion FY 2014: $485 billion FY 2013: $679 billion. FY 2012: $1.087 trillion FY 2011: $1.3 trillion. FY 2010: $1.294 trillion. FY 2009: Added $253 billion in stimulus spending to the Bush budget.For more, see How Much Has Obama Added to the Debt and Deficit by President.No Personal Scandal - One achievement has gone unnoticed but is nevertheless admirable. That's Obama's unblemished personal record. President Obama has served longer than any president in decades without the appearance of the word \u201cscandal\u201d on the front page of the Washington Post. For more accomplishments, see Obama's Top 50 Accomplishments. Obama's AdvisersPart of the reason for Obama's success is his first team of economic advisers. Many of them helped formulate the policies he outlined during his 2008 campaign platform, including an aggressive fiscal stimulus plan to put the country back on track. He was applauded for appointing former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker as the head of the Economic Advisory Panel. He named Mary Schapiro head of the Securities and Exchange Commission following the Madoff Ponzi scheme. However, he was criticized for including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who oversaw repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. By January 2011, infighting had sent Larry Summers, Christina Romer, Peter Orszag, and Paul Volcker on their way. Obama's Early YearsBarack Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 19651. He received his B.A. from Columbia University in 1983. in and his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1991. He was a professor of constitutional law for the University of Chicago from 1992 to 2004. He published his autobiography Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance in 1995.He became an Illinois State Senator in 1996. He served until he became a U.S. Senator in 2005. He gained national attention when he spoke on behalf of John Keery at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He published The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream in 2006.

{"title": "How to Use Budgeting and Budgetary Controls as a Tool of Management", "text": "A budget shows what a company can afford to spend and expects to bring in financially during a given period. It is an essential tool of business operations; a company cannot operate unless it knows how much money it has and what its costs are. Company leaders must use some form of budgetary control to stay on track. A budgetary control is simply a technique, usually a comparative analysis, that lets a business see whether or not it is accomplishing its financial goals.Divide the business into sections based on the functions they serve. Categorize each section into one of four primary budget centers: revenue, expenses, profit and investment.Look at the company's goals \u2014 that is, review what the company hopes to achieve. Conduct market research to determine what it will cost to reach each of these goals. If the company opts for traditional budgeting, some data can be pulled from the budget for the previous budget period. Prepare new, individual budgets for each budget center based on company objectives and assign managers to oversee those budgets.Consolidate the individual budgets for each budget center to present a comprehensive budget for all company activity that corresponds to company objectives.Gather data from operational and strategic management systems, as well as professional analysis, to determine whether objectives have been met and what income and expenses the company had during the budget period.Analyze data to determine which budget centers had differences between the adopted budget and actual spending and income.Schedule a budget meeting with managers who had some level of control regarding handling of the budget for each budget center.Present data and point out key areas where budget variances happened. Ask the managers responsible for those areas to explain the variances. In some cases, budget variances are legitimate; for example, if the overall market cost of supplies rises. In other cases, the variances reflect poor managerial decisions; for example, if the person(s) responsible for investing company funds fails to address the risks of investing in particular stocks or bonds. A good budget is flexible enough to accommodate legitimate variances but does not accommodate a lack of responsibility.Brainstorm on ways to reduce or eliminate the variances noted in the analysis. Note the suggestions so they can be presented as motions during upcoming board of directors meetings.If necessary, amend the budget for each budget center, as well as the overall budget, if evidence shows that it is not possible to meet objectives given the budget that was adopted. If required, amend the company's objectives. This is a much more drastic managerial step, as it points business operations in a new direction; but if managers are doing all they can to stay within budget and cannot reach presented goals, it may be necessary.Enforce any discipline that may be warranted given the variances present in the comprehensive analysis. For example, you might withhold performance bonuses if budgets are not met."}

However, those numbers are only projections and, while there\u2019s a lot of research and data behind them, they aren\u2019t foolproof. That\u2019s because no one can factor in the unexpected, such as a major recall, especially one that has negative publicity attached to it.

That\u2019s $225 less than the retail price of a new iPhone 6S.\nAnd you can get an even better deal with a gently used phone, says Brendan McCue, sales manager and gadget analyst for NextWorth, which buys used phones and recycles or resells them.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re OK with a phone with some scratches on the back or a dent \u2014 you can throw a new case on it, and you\u2019re going to save a lot of money,\u201d McCue says.\n\u00bb MORE: How much data do you really need?\nThe first step to buying a used phone is finding a trusted site, which can be tricky. Craigslist is riddled with scams, and it can be hard to tell whether newer online retailers are legit. Then, once you settle on a site and start shopping for phones, it\u2019s important to ask the right questions before clicking the \u201cBuy\u201d button.\nWhere to buy a used cell phone\nLook for a retailer that has buyer protections, says McCue, who bought his used phone on eBay. Seller ratings and detailed phone descriptions are also helpful when purchasing a phone online, as is the ability to ask the seller questions.\nHere are a few trusted places to shop for a used cell phone:\neBay: Sellers can upload photos and give detailed descriptions of the phone\u2019s condition. You can also ask questions to get more information (more on that below). With eBay\u2019s money back guarantee, you can return the phone for a full refund if it isn\u2019t exactly as the seller described. Amazon: You can purchase used and refurbished phones directly from manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Motorola and LG, or from a third-party reseller. Sellers on Amazon are rated and reviewed by other buyers, so be sure to read reviews before purchasing. Certified refurbished phones sold through Amazon come with a 90-day warranty. Warranties on other phones vary by seller. Swappa: The site reviews listings to ensure the device serial number is clean (read: not stolen) and requires sellers to upload photos of the phone, powered on, next to a custom listing code to ensure the seller has the device. Swappa uses PayPal for all payments. Gazelle: Each device is inspected to make sure the phone charges correctly, the speaker and microphone work, the touch screen is functional and the phone will connect to Wi-Fi. You\u2019re buying the phone directly from Gazelle, rather than an individual seller, and there is a 30-day return window for all devices. Your carrier: Most wireless carriers sell refurbished phones. These phones are typically more expensive than what you\u2019d find on other sites. Verizon, for example, sells a certified preowned iPhone 5S for $312. The same model sells for about $150 on Swappa. But buying from a carrier means that you know the phone will work with your carrier. You also know it\u2019s not stolen and it typically has a limited warranty. This should give you more peace of mind than buying that used iPhone on Craigslist.\n\u00bb COMPARE: Best cell phone plans\nWhat to ask before buying a used cell phone\nBuying from a trusted site takes some of the risk out of buying a used phone, but you still need to ensure you can activate and use the phone when it arrives.\nWhat is the serial number? Also known as the ESN or IMEI. This is a crucial piece of information to get, because you\u2019ll need it to verify whether the phone has been registered as lost or stolen. If it has, you won\u2019t be able to activate the phone. The serial number will also tell you whether the phone will work with your carrier. Most carriers let you check this online, but you can also go to a store or call customer service.\nIs the phone under contract or lease agreement? Phones under a contract or lease can\u2019t be reactivated until the agreement is fulfilled. So, if the seller has a year left on the contract, it will be at least a year before you can activate the phone.\nDoes the phone have water damage? Moisture erodes a phone\u2019s components over time. So while the device may look fine and work well now, it won\u2019t last long if it\u2019s been exposed to water. Unfortunately, you typically can\u2019t look at a phone and tell if it has water damage, so you\u2019re trusting the seller to be honest.\nFor added security, don\u2019t pay cash or directly from your checking account. Instead, pick a payment method that has built-in protections, such as PayPal. Ramon Khan went that route when he purchased a used phone on Swappa.\n\u201cI did a triple-threat kind of deal here in a way,\u201d Khan says. \u201cI went through a site that had buyer protection already built in, used PayPal to protect my purchase and also used my Discover card, which issues refunds regardless of the refund policy of a website.\u201d\nNerdWallet has partnered with BillShark, a company that can help save you money by negotiating your bills for you.

{"title": "Solutions if the Bank Won&#39;t Give You a Checking Account", "text": "Question: Help! I Can't Open a Checking Account, What Are My Options?If you are unable to open a checking account you may be at a loss on what you are going to do to pay your bills. Many people take for granted the benefits and advantages that a checking account affords them. It is easy to write checks and pay your bills online with automatic draft or a debit card. If you find that you are unable to open a checking account you do have a few options available to you.Try Opening an Account at Another BankFirst, you should look at other banks and credit unions in your area. You may not qualify for the best account at the bank, but many banks may work with you by having you pay higher fees. You may be required to open a CD as collateral for your account. Credit unions are generally much easier to work with, as well. You should find a bank that will allow you to open a savings account. This will help you to build a relationship with the bank, which may open the door in a few years.Clear Up Your ChexSystems ReportIf you have been reported to ChexSystems, then you will need to clear up the report before you can open an account. Generally, this means that you owe a bank money for an account that you have overdrawn. The bank may have closed your bank account for you, and refuse to do business with you in the future. If you go in and talk to the bank, you can find out how much you owe and work out a plan to pay it off. They may want you to make a lump payment, which means saving up for a few months or weeks to pay it off. Most banks will not even let you open a savings account until you have cleared up your ChexSystems report.Use Alternative Methods to Pay Your BillsIf you find that you cannot find a bank or credit union that will work with you, you will need to address the way that you pay your bills and mortgage. You may need to switch to money orders for some of your major bills. You should never send cash through the mail. You can purchase money orders through your bank, the post office or many other locations. You should shop around and find the price that is right for you. When you pay this way be sure to include your account number on each money order. You should also keep a ledger at home that states the money order number and place that it was purchased and what bill it went towards in case it becomes lost in the mail. You can also use a prepaid credit card to pay bills online. This option may make it easier to keep functioning without an account.Try Switching to CashThis is an excellent time to switch to the envelope budgeting system. You should not resort to using credit cards for the majority of your purchases. You do need to add to the financial mess that got you here in the first place. By switching to cash only you can begin to discipline yourself for when you are able to open an account again. The biggest advantage is that once your money is gone it is gone and there is no way to keep spending it. This does mean that you need to budget carefully.See if You Qualify for a Prepaid Credit CardAdditionally, you may consider getting a prepaid credit card to make online purchases or to rent a car. These cards will not allow you to spend over the amount that you deposit on the card. You will pay a fee every time that you deposit money, but the convenience may outweigh the cost when you are in this type of financial situation.Commit to Changing the Way You Handle MoneyYou should make a commitment that you will begin to live on a budget and get your finances under control so that you are never in this situation again. You may have a few tough years ahead of you, but you can come out ahead if you stick with the program and begin taking control of your spending and saving habits. This will help you to turn this headache into a positive situation."}
{"title": "Want 5 Steps to Customize Your Communication for Your Audience?", "text": "Know your audience. It\u2019s a fundamental principle of great communication. Understanding the perspective of the people you're talking to helps you become a better presenter and HR professional.Know your audience. Know what they care about. Know what they want to hear.  And by knowing them, and focusing your message, you show that you are a resource. You engage your audience and have a greater impact.  The problem? This process takes time, and it\u2019s always easier to do a brain dump of all of the things that you know or want to tell someone about a topic. Thinking critically about what that person wants or needs to hear is tougher.A trap I've seen a lot of HR professionals get caught up in is giving an: Everything They Should Know or Do presentation. You know you've fallen into this trap when you find yourself putting bullet points on slides instead of thinking about:what the audience really cares about, what your most important points are, and mapping them into a clear story that creates an engaging talk.  The second trap many HR professionals fall into is repeating that same presentation day in and day out to different audiences. The problem is that different audiences care about and respond to different things - so if you want to be engaging, you need to tailor your message every time you speak.This is how to ensure that you customize your message, cut through the noise, and keep your audience engaged with what you\u2019re telling them - no matter who or where they are.Know what they care about.As you plan your presentation, ask what are the so what\u2019s for them?  What are the three to four main questions or issues on their minds about your topic?  If you don\u2019t know, ask a few people, or make your best guess.Then start your presentation by saying it back to them, \u201cI know several of you have been wondering X about our benefits options, or \u201cI imagine that these three things are what you really want to get out of this workshop\u201d.  When you talk first about your audience and the problems of theirs you\u2019ll address in your talk, you demonstrate that you care about them.  That makes people want to listen.Map out your main points.Most presentations feel like an information dump, not a clear story with a set of main points.  We usually know much more than other people want or need to know about our topics.  Authors Chip and Dan Heath, in their book Made to Stick called this \u201cthe curse of knowledge\u201d. When was the last time you felt a presentation was too short, or covered too little information? Probably rarely.  The people who stand out as presenters, the ones who get heard and have influence, start with the problem of the audience\u2019s that they are solving, and then separate the must know from the nice to know.Take half of whatever preparation time you have to focus on the heart of your presentation and what your audience needs to know that will help them. The best way to break the \u201ccurse of knowledge\u201d is to  focus on what\u2019s most important to both you and the audience.  Map it out on a whiteboard or piece of paper, or use a set of sticky notes. What sequence of points is best? Is there an order that will make more sense for them? How do your points relate to each other? Make it clear. If they don\u2019t, tell people, \u201cHere\u2019s a totally different, yet important, topic\u201d.  Tell stories, use examples.Besides trying to present too many things at once, all too often presentations sound abstract and unrelated to the daily life of the audience. What happens then is that people tune out, sit through the talk, assume it\u2019s not about them, and take no action. This makes the presentation a waste of their time and yours.  To relate to them, to help them take action, people need the ideas grounded in stories and examples. Human brains are wired to relate to stories, and to remember them. So, cover fewer points - better - with examples.  Tell stories about how to use the idea you\u2019re sharing. Whether it\u2019s how to solve a compensation problem, how to give feedback, how to sign up for your vision plan, or how the new organization is different from the old one, tell stories. Make the bridge clear between your topic and their life.Show, don\u2019t just tell.  A picture is worth... Presenters who use too much text often use excuses like, \u201cBut I have to communicate very specific information!\u201d or, \u201cMy audiences will be better able to digest this complicated idea if I write it down\u201d. No, you don\u2019t, and no, they won\u2019t.  Unless your goal is to have the effect of taking two Ambien, cut the text. Send it in a follow-up email, or share it in a doc. The visuals you use need to support the story, not become your script.   Once you have your clear set of main points and a good flow supported by stories and examples, only then should you launch a presentation tool.Otherwise you end up with your slides serving double duty as your speaker notes. In that case, you should have just emailed the presentation instead of wasting your audience\u2019s time.Tailor, and improvise.Once you've created a good presentation that visually supports your main message, you have the freedom to tailor it to each audience. You can make your point and then ask out loud, \u201cSo why should you care about this?\u201d and tailor your answer to the audience in front of you.  In 20 years of training and making presentations for leaders at dozens of organizations like Apple, Oracle, SAP, and T-Mobile, I've seen over and over the power of a simple set of messages. When the messages were supported by simple images and delivered by a focused presenter who could make clear points and connect them to the daily life of their audience, communication occurred.

{"title": "Bob Hope&#39;s Savvy Real Estate Investments", "text": "The world will remember Bob Hope for the pure enjoyment he gave us during his long years in the entertainment industry, for his love of golf and the work he did to promote that sport, and for his dedication to lifting the spirits of our US armed forces. But did you know he was a very successful real estate investor? In fact, at one point in his career, he may have been one of the biggest landholders in the state of California.Bob Hope's Land PurchasesBob began buying California real estate early in his career, focusing on land purchases. He was even known as \"Mr. Real Estate,\" because he owned so much land. Funds from oil well investments that performed well made it possible to add even more land tracts to his portfolio. His buddy, Bing Crosby, used oil investments to purchase California real estate, too. Smart guys--we all know what those properties are selling for today!One of Hope's most interesting purchases was a unique, \"space age\" home built in Palm Springs during the 1970's. While an extraordinary architectural achievement, the house (valued at about $23 million dollars) has proved to be difficult to sell--even to the ultra-rich. Designed by architect John Lautner, the house was built of concrete, steel, and glass. According to the New York Times, it \u201cwas built to resemble a volcano, with three visor-like arches and an undulating concrete roof, a hole at its center opening a courtyard to the sky.\u201dHow Much Was Bob Hope's Land Worth?There are many different stories about the value of Hope's real estate holdings--and, of course, their value varied over the years. According to a 2003 story in Forbes Magazine: So just how much was Leslie Townes Hope worth? Many of the estimates being kicked around are based on a Time magazine story from 1967 that said the comedian owned \u201c8,000 acres in Palm Springs, 4,000 to 5,000 acres near Phoenix, more than 7,500 acres in Malibu,\u201d and more. Hope was thought to have enough land to make a principality nearly 50 times the size of Monaco, with just as fine a climate.The Forbes story goes on to describe a process by which the magazine actually priced Hope's remaining holdings:By the mid-1980s Mr. Hope, then in his 80s, was already tidying up his estate and liquidating much of his property in an orderly manner. Forbes ultimately estimated his remaining land holdings to be worth just $85 million.What Happened to Bob Hope's Land?Hope bought a great deal of land during the 1960s and 1970s but did not hold onto most of it for very long. He gave some tracts of land to conservancy groups, but most land disposed of was sold. He was an aggressive owner who was prepared to fight for his rights and property values when a local community tried to acquire a portion of his land through condemnation proceedings.Bob and Dolores Hope bought their Toluca Lake, California, home in 1940. When Dolores died at the age of 102, the house went on the market."}
{"title": "How to Plot a Pad for a Mobile Home", "text": "A mobile home is a structure built of wood and metal on a steel frame. It is manufactured in an industrial factory and transported by truck to its setup location. The home is raised on blocks, called \"two-cell\" blocks, and secured to the ground by steel straps with auger anchors running 4 6to feet deep. In some locations, mobile homes must be installed over a concrete pad.\n\nMobile homes are set up on blocks or on concrete pads.\n\nStep\n\nContact the local county and/or city building permitting department. Ask for the requirements for mobile home installation on a concrete pad. Write down the dimension requirements such as pad length, width and depth along with the permitting fees. Ask to be sent a building permit application.\n\nStep\n\nPhone a concrete pouring service. Speak to a service provider about installing a mobile home on a concrete pad. These contractors are usually well versed in the county and/or city permitting process as well as the mobile home installation process. Request an estimate to deliver and pour the concrete pad.\n\nStep\n\nMeasure the mobile home to calculate the dimensions of the concrete pad. Take the length and width of the manufactured home and increase the dimensions to comply with the county and/or city building permit. For instance, if the mobile home is 14 feet wide by 40 feet long, most permits require there to be at least a 1- to 2-foot surplus on all sides of the home.\n\nStep\n\nComplete the permit application along with the concrete contractor. Mail or deliver it to the permitting agency along with any applicable fees. Receive the building permit and schedule a date and time to have the concrete pad poured."}
{"title": "Adolescence, The Middle Class and Your On-Time Delivery", "text": "It's misguided to think that just because a thing is a thing and has been a thing for some period of time, that this thing is meant to last.  Even Johnny Rzeznik of the Goo-Goo Dolls knows that \"\u2026everything's meant to be broken\u2026\" So while you might be a parent and might be lamenting that your kid's adolescence seems excruciatingly painful (for everyone involved) and interminable, it will inevitably end.And, even for the things that have been around and that you want to last, you can't take for granted that those things will be around forever.For instance, let's say that your company has been nailing your customers' on-time delivery. And that you've been running 100% on-time delivery for weeks or months or years. Well, unless you're committed not just to maintaining the 100% on-time delivery but taking the specific actions required to make sure that your unblemished record continues to happen, your on-time delivery could vanish as quickly as your kid's acne. One day, your customers are giving you a plaque commemorating your spotless delivery record and the next, your daughter's buying you a beer and telling you that she's moving to the other side of the country to take a job with a tech startup.That's how fast it can change. If you're not committed to keeping a thing around - it will drift toward its natural state of entropy. Families break apart, supply chains sub-optimize and the middle-class fractures.There's no hard and fast date as to when the American middle class was born.  It can be argued that the American middle class arose during the Roaring 1920's.  Prior to the Roaring 1920's, the majority of America's working class were poor.Then, with the Treaty of Versailles and the close of World War One, America transitioned to a robust, consumer economy.  The 1920's saw the introduction of the mass-produced motor car and the explosion of jazz music and kick off of a professional sports league that would one day become the National Football League (but in 1920 was founded as the American Professional Football Association and included 14 teams like the Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Dayton Triangles and Decatur Staleys).  And then - voila! - welcome to the American middle class.The Crash of 1929 and the resulting Great Depression caused a setback for the middle class.  But with the GI Bill and the return of our troops from Europe and Asia after World War Two, the middle class became - what many felt was permanent - woven into the fabric of Americana.  The middle-class bargain - that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead - never felt more achievable.But now, less than a hundred years on - there are whispers that the middle class is in danger of disappearing. The possibility that the American middle class might vanish has elicited screams of anguish from those who thought its existence was as indelible as the venerable granite face of New Hampshire's Old Man of the Mountain - a series of jagged cliff faces in the White Mountains that looked like a human face in profile and which was carved by glaciers sometime between 6,000 years and 17,000 years B.C. The Old Man of the Mountain was so highly regarded that New Hampshire put its image on the official New Hampshire statehood twenty-five cent piece. Daniel Webster and Nathaniel Hawthorne both wrote about the Old Man of the Mountain. And then, with no one watching in the middle of the night, the Old Man of the Mountain collapsed into rubble in 2003. Turns out it wasn't an old man after all, but more like the adolescence of a mountain face that was destined to end, to transition into something different.If the American middle class disappears within the next decade or so, it will have lasted about a hundred years.  Not only would that barely register in the annals of history - but it wouldn't have lasted as long as the Chinese Liao Dynasty (10th Century to 12th Century) or the pointed-toe shoes fad of the European Middle Ages (12th Century to 14th Century). And while the Liao family probably mourned the passing of their dynasty and European noblemen lamented they could no longer wear extended phallic symbols on their feet - we barely remember them today.Is that's what's destined to become of the American middle class? Is it destined to become an unread footnote in a future history text?That depends on whether you view the American middle class as you would your kid's adolescence - something with a finite lifespan. Or do you view the American middle class as you would your company's on-time delivery performance?With on-time delivery, you have control over whether your performance continues or has a finite lifespan.  Chances are you achieved your 100% on-time delivery by communicating with your customers and understanding their demand, oftentimes better than even they understood it. Robust demand management is a key element of customer satisfaction.But even more than that, you understood that your company doesn't have just one lead time to contend with. You have many lead times. You have the time it takes you to deliver an order to a customer. You have the time it takes for you to receive products from your own suppliers - and then inspect them, do any value added manufacturing to those products and then put them to stock. You have the time it takes your own suppliers to ship those products to you (whether that's across an ocean or through the skies or over land). And you have the time it takes for your suppliers to make your products, including the lead times it takes them to acquire their components and raw materials.That's a lot of lead times to manage. And, yes, because you've achieved 100% on-time delivery, you have managed them all.And on top of that, you've figured out how to maintain 100% inventory accuracy. That's right. How can you ship a customer what it wants, if you don't know if you have it on hand?  100% inventory accuracy means that you've got a viable inventory system - whether that's a multi-million dollar ERP system, an Excel spreadsheet or a yellow legal pad tacked to your stock room's door.  As long as the information in your inventory control system matches the actual inventory you have on hand, you're rocking 100% inventory accuracy.Now that you've got all the pieces in place and you've achieved 100% on-time delivery, it's time to kick back and let the process run itself, right? I mean, to have the processes in place to keep your performance moving along - that's the goal.But beware.  Just like the American middle class, your on-time delivery can be besieged by threats.A massive recession can send millions of middle-class Americans to the unemployment lines. And a key supplier who goes out of business can jeopardize your ability to supply your customers. I don't know enough to advise on how to avoid recessions (and I presume nobody really does or we wouldn't have them) but with your suppliers, it's important to do regular supplier relationship management checkups.  When was the last time you checked the credit rating, financial statement of DUNs reports of your existing suppliers?  It's common to vet those things when first onboarding a supplier, but it's equally as important to do it again very couple years or so.A widening wealth gap can drive more middle-class families into poverty. And the loss of inventory control can cause you to miss deliveries to your customers. Once again, I have no solutions regarding how to close the wealth gap in the United States. But the solution might be easier to find if not for all the shouting, name-calling and lack of detailed nuance by those whose jobs it is - is to find that solution.  Solving inventory control concerns is easier.  Conducting physical inventories and regular cycle counts are all you really need to do - and all that takes is hard work and cooperation across people who may not want to get along, but realize that for the greater good they need to roll up their sleeves and count what they have, what matters most.And maybe that's all it will really take to save the American middle class."}
{"title": "Are You Qualified to Be a Police Officer?", "text": "Before you fill out that application to be a police officer, there are a lot of things to consider. Besides the important questions of whether or not this may be the right career for you or whether you can handle the emotional, mental and physical rigors that come with a day on the job, there's one important question on which your entire career hopes will hinge: are you qualified to be a law enforcement officer?Few would disagree that not just anyone can be a cop, but what exactly are the qualifications you have to meet before you can become a police officer?Reasonable RegulationsIn the United States, each state sets its own requirements that prospective police officer must meet in order to be hired or even to attend a police academy. The reason is to ensure - as best as possible - that the right people are doing the job.Considering that officers have the authority to make arrests and use force, not to mention the fact that they have access to large amounts of sensitive and private information, naturally, the public has a vested interest in making sure that the people holding these positions be trustworthy. To the extent possible, state requirements for law enforcement officers are designed to provide a minimum baseline departments must follow in hiring officers.So What Are the Requirements to Be a Police Officer?Specific requirements will vary from state to state, but they generally follow the same pattern. Typically, in order to qualify to be a police officer in the United States you must:Be at least 19 years old (some states and individual departments may require you to be 21 or older)Be a United States citizen (either born or naturalized)At least a high school graduate and often have some collegePrior military service, a college degree or other relevant work experienceHave a valid driver licenseNot have been convicted of or plead no contest to a felonyBe of good moral characterBe physically capable of doing the jobBe fluent in the English languageWhat Do the Requirements to Be a Police Officer Mean for You?Most of the standard requirements to work in law enforcement are objective and easy to interpret; for example, you either are or are not old enough, or you either have a driver license or you don't. On the other hand, there are a couple requirements that may leave you wondering still whether or not you're qualified for the job.With regard to determining whether you are of good moral character, states don't usually have a list of behaviors that are or are not okay. Instead, they rely on general principles, such as your past criminal history, defaulted loans or other debts, or previously undetected crimes (crimes that you committed, but weren't caught).Individual law enforcement departments are usually left to make the determination on whether or not your moral character is up to their standards, which is why they conduct such stringent background investigations and may require a polygraph exam and a psychological exam to determine your suitability for law enforcement.Read More About What Police Departments Look for In Background ChecksWith regards to whether or not you meet the physical requirements for the job, the first step to finding out is by seeing a physician and getting a physical exam. You can also learn about the specific physical testing employed by your department of choice - whether a physical abilities test or a physical fitness assessment - and see how you measure up. That can give you an idea of where you're at, as well as where you need to be to get qualified.What If You Don't Meet the Qualifications to Be An Officer?Law enforcement isn't for everyone, but that doesn't have to mean that you're out of options. Depending on why you don't qualify for a job as a police officer, there are many other career options within criminology an criminal justice for you to choose from. With a little research and solid effort, you can find the right criminology career for you."}
{"title": "Saturn makes bold marketing move", "text": "Whether it\u2019s a move born of confidence or a strategy rooted in desperation, General Motors is taking a bold step by asking its Saturn dealers to equip their showrooms with examples of 2007 Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords. The idea is to give shoppers a chance to really compare side-by-side the attributes of the two best-selling sedans in the United States with Saturn\u2019s Aura sedan. Expect Chevrolet to also go the comparison route when the new Malibu is unveiled later this year. GM has been frustrated by slow sales of the Aura, which has received considerable praise in the automotive press but hasn\u2019t caught the fancy of the majority of people looking for a new mid-size sedan. The thinking at GM is that buyers automatically go with either the Camry or the Accord because it has been many years \u2014 not since the Ford Taurus \u2014 since an American manufacturer offered a legitimate contender. Saturn\u2019s Aura does compare favorably to the Camry and the Accord. The front-wheel-drive Aura comes with a choice of three engines \u2014 two 6-cylinder engines and GM\u2019s first use of a gas-electric hybrid in a sedan \u2014 and an upscale cockpit that is far better than anything Saturn has previously offered. Pricing is very competitive, ranging from about $20,000 to $25,000. But the real question is whether consumers will stop by a Saturn dealership and use the comparison GM is setting up. Recent studies have suggested that the average consumer begins shopping for a new car with a list narrowed to two vehicles. By one estimate, as many as 50 percent of buyers never take a test drive in the car they eventually buy. Thanks to online tools and widespread media reviews of vehicles, the days when buyers would trek from dealership to dealership are gone.

{"title": "How to Calculate Basis Points", "text": "A basis point is the smallest increment used to state bond yields or other interest rates. Put another way, a basis point is the smallest amount by which the rate can change. One basis point equals one hundredth of 1 percent. Finance professionals use basis points for clarity. For example, if you say an 8 percent rate rose by 2 percent, it's not clear if you mean the new rate is 8.16 percent or 10 percent. If you say the rate went up 16 basis points, the meaning is clear.\n\nChanges in interest rates are often calculated using basis points.\n\ncredit: Sebastian Duda/iStock/Getty Images\n\nBasis Point Computations\n\nCalculate the number of basis points in an interest rate by multiplying the percentage rate by 100. For example, an interest rate increase of 0.50 percent multiplied by 100 equals 50 basis points. If you want to go in the other direction and convert basis points to a percentage figure, divide the number of basis points by 100. Thus, 125 basis points divided by 100 equals 1.25 percent."}

{"title": "Is a 401k the Same as an IRA for Filing Taxes?", "text": "Traditional individual retirement accounts and 401k plans both offer tax-deferred retirement savings options. IRAs are created by individuals while 401k plans are offered through employers. Though the tax treatment by the Internal Revenue Service is similar, the process of reporting contributions and withdrawals from these two accounts differs. Knowing how to report them on your taxes can help you avoid tax penalties for incorrect filing.\n\nMaking Contributions\n\nThe the process for making contributions to IRAs differs from contributing to a 401k plan. For IRAs, the contributions are made from you to the account, typically held at a bank or other financial institution. These contributions do not affect your paycheck. Contributions to a 401k plan, on the other hand, come out of your paycheck and go directly into your 401k plan without you having to touch the money.\n\nEffects\n\nSince your employer knows exactly how much you have contributed to your 401k plan, the employer takes that into consideration when figuring how much taxable income you have for the year. For example, if your total salary equals $43,200, but you put $6,200 into your 401k plan, your employer would only report that you have $37,000 in income subject to federal income taxes because the money contributed to the 401k plan would already be accounted for on your W-2 form. As a result, you do not need to deduct the amount of your contribution on your taxes. With an IRA, since the contributions are made independently of your employer, you do have to report the contribution on your taxes so you can claim the tax deduction, assuming you are eligible.\n\nTaking Money Out\n\nWhen you withdraw money from either a 401k plan or IRA, the money is treated as taxable income that must be reported on your taxes the same way. However, the IRS requires that you report these amount separately. IRA distributions are reported on the \"IRA Distributions\" line of your tax return while you report 401k plan distributions on the \"Pension and Annuities Distributions\" line.\n\nEarly Withdrawals\n\nIRAs and 401k plans have different early withdrawal requirements to avoid the 10 percent early withdrawal tax penalty, imposed on most withdrawals before age 59-1/2, that must be reported when you file your income taxes. Some exceptions, such as medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income or suffering a permanent disability, apply to both. However, you can only avoid the early withdrawal penalty for college expenses or a first time home purchase with an IRA withdrawal. For only 401k plans, you can avoid the tax penalty if you retire after turning 55.\n\nMandatory Withdrawals\n\nThe IRS subjects both 401k plans and traditional IRAs to required minimum distributions starting at age 70-1/2 and imposes a 50 percent penalty on the amount not taken out from either a 401k plan or an IRA. However, the IRS allows an exception for 401k plans if the employee is still working, as long as she is not a 5 percent or greater owner in the business sponsoring the 401k plan. However, the tax treatment of required minimum distributions is the same."}
{"title": "Personal Checking Account Software", "text": "Personal checking account software can help you to manage your budget, pay bills electronically and monitor account balances. If you're living hand-to-mouth, the software can alert you to potential problems, such as an overdrawn account. People who regularly track their money tend to grow wealthier over the long term in comparison to people who don't, according to \"The Wall Street Journal\" guide on \"How to Choose and Use Financial Software.\"\n\nWoman using laptop to check bank account with debit card in hand.\n\ncredit: Jupiterimages/Stockbyte/Getty Images\n\nTypes of Software\n\nWhen you drive, you can control your car through the dashboard \u2013 a central place with gauges for gas, speed and temperature. Financial software acts like a dashboard for your personal checking account, enabling you to manage your finances from a central place. There are two main types of software. Known as desktop solutions, money management programs \u2013 Microsoft Money, Quicken or iCash \u2013 can be installed on your computer. The second type is a web-based program, such as Mint, Geezeo or Wesabe. The advantage of web-based software is that if your computer crashes, your financial data remains unaffected.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe most important feature of personal checking account software is its support of your financial institution. If you can't plug into your banking data, you're back to using a spreadsheet or pen and paper. The software should allow you to set up budgets, customize categories and create bill reminders as email or text alerts. According to Mason Currey's 2008 article \"Show Me My Money\" in \"Slate,\" a feature missing from most software was the ability to see pending transactions. If you're down to the wire, you may have to log in to your online checking account to view an updated balance.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nAccording to PC Mag, the majority of personal finance applications are as secure as the credit cards tucked in your pocketbook. Personal checking account software typically uses 128-bit encryption \u2013 bank standard \u2013 or even military-standard 256-bit encryption. You should check to see if the software has been verified by provider of Internet infrastructure services, such as VeriSign, MacAfee or TRUSTe. Because your password is your first line of defense against theft or fraud, set up a strong password according to the software's instructions.\n\nSelf-Service Deposits\n\nWhile consumers can already use their cell phones to track personal checking accounts, some banks offer clients a way to deposit checks via phones with cameras. For example, depositors enrolled in Chase Bank's online program can use a mobile application to take pictures of an endorsed check and route them to Chase, according to Becky Yerak's 2010 article \"New Wave of Banking: Check Deposit via Smart-Phone Photo\" on Phys.org. Chase confirms the deposit by sending you a text message. Because many banks depend on foot traffic at retail branches to cross-sell financial products, they remain resistant to self-service deposits."}
{"title": "Great Tips for Septic System Maintenance Every Homeowner Should Know", "text": "Septic tank maintenance is not just for people who live on a farm. You might be surprised to discover that some city dwellers need septic tank maintenance. Most folks who live in a rural area probably have a septic system instead of a sewer connection, but septic systems are in place all over the country. Taking care of your septic system isn't difficult because upgraded systems function efficiently when you follow a few basic guidelines. Put these tips to use for a clean and trouble-free septic system.Proper Installation Is KeyHave your septic system installed properly to avoid problems down the road. When you apply for a building permit, health officials in your jurisdiction will perform soil test or percolation test to confirm that the ground will support a septic system. Inspectors will also visit your building site to verify that the property has the conditions required for a non-problematic septic system.Don't Overload the Septic Tank and DrainfieldCheck faucets and toilets for leaks; make repairs if necessary.Crawl under your house or look in the basement, if you have one, to look for more leaks.Use aerators on faucets and flow reducer nozzles on showers to help lower water consumption.Reduce water levels for small loads of laundry or consider buying energy-efficient appliances.Wait until the dishwasher is full to run it or try a shorter dishwashing cycle, which uses less water.Use a displacer (even a brick will work) to reduce the amount of water needed to flush the toilet.Don't Use the Toilet as a Garbage DisposalNever flush cat litter, disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, tampons, paper towels, facial tissues, coffee grounds or cigarette butts and filters down the toilet. These types of items clog septic tanks in less time than you might imagine.Don't Pour Grease Down the DrainGrease can clog the septic drainfield, making it impossible for soil to absorb liquids. If you pour too much grease down the drain, you'll need a new drainfield, which can be costly.Divert Rainwater From the Septic DrainfieldA soggy drainfield won't absorb and neutralize liquid waste. Plan landscaping, roof gutters and foundation drains so that excess water is diverted away from the septic drainfield.Keep Trees Away from the Septic SystemDiscourage root damage by keeping trees at least 100 feet away from the septic system.Trees with very aggressive roots, such as willows, should be even farther away from the system.Use Garbage Disposals WiselyA garbage disposal can double the amount of solids added to a septic tank. Are you sure you even need a garbage disposal? I removed mine from under the sink and have a lot more space as a result, plus I don't miss it.If you replace your disposal, then choose a top-line disposal unit that grinds food into tiny particles that are easier for a system to \"digest.\"Minimize Heavy-Duty CleanersOveruse of heavy-duty cleaners kills beneficial bacteria in the septic tank, so solids won't break down as well.Avoid Hazardous ChemicalsVarnish, paint thinners, motor oils, gasoline and other similar chemicals can ruin your system and are a hazard to groundwater. Store used hazardous chemicals in appropriate containers and dispose of them in accordance with your jurisdiction's hazardous waste laws.Protect the System from DamageDo not drive over the drainfield, build a structure on top of it, or cover it with concrete or asphalt.Do plant grass on the drainfield to minimize soil erosion.Perform Regular MaintenanceSolids must eventually be pumped from the tank. Many experts advise a family of four with a 1,000-gallon septic tank to have the tank pumped after three to five years of full-time use. Other experts say you can go much longer between pumping operations.Never attempt to open a septic tank yourself. It contains dangerous gasses and bacteria.Edited by Elizabeth Weintraub, Home Buying Expert.

They provide 30 free online trades per month so long as you maintain $25,000 in cash in your account, plus you still get all the great features you\u2019d expect from WellsTrade:\nAsset classes: You can trade stocks, options, bonds, and mutual funds.\nService and Support: 24/7 customer service, broker-assisted trading and physical branches.\nData: Free research and streaming data.\nAccessibility: Check writing services and debit card available.\nYou may be thinking that since WellsTrade provides all these great features, you might as well open an account before April 1 in order to receive the free trades. However, Merrill Edge provides some benefits that WellsTrade simply can\u2019t match:\nCheaper prices: If you manage to use up all your free trades, Merrill Edge charges $6.95 per stock trade and $6.95 + $0.75 per contract for options. How does WellsTrade compare? $8.95 per stock trade and $9.95 + $1.00 per options contract.\nLower margin rates: Merrill Edge\u2019s maximum margin rate is 8.625% versus WellsTrade\u2019s 9.125%.\nNo account fees: If your balance drops below $50,000 for some reason, Wells Fargo will charge a $30 monthly service fee.\nAdvanced analysis platform: Merrill Edge MarketPro is available to anyone customer that makes at least 15 trades per quarter or maintains $50,000 in their account.\nNow, you may be thinking that Merrill Edge sounds great, but you can\u2019t afford to keep $25,000 in cash right now. Well, if you want to keep all the great features mentioned above, the best option is going to be Scottrade. It\u2019s just $7 per stock trade, and an extra $20 if you decide you\u2019d like to talk to a broker. And how\u2019s the platform? You get real-time data and charting in a customizable package.\nOf course, maybe you don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles in your brokerage account. You want a good price and a great promotion. OptionsHouse offers both with a $4.95 charge per trade and commission-free trading for your first 60 days (with promotion code 60FREE and $5,000 account balance. Maximum 100 trades). There are also no account fees or inactivity charges.\nFrankly, every one of these accounts is trustworthy and is going to provide comparable execution services. So you, as a customer, simply need to decide which account features you want and how much you\u2019re willing to pay for a trade. Does WellsTrade\u2019s customer service justify paying twice the price in commissions? Does it seem fair that they charge you an \u201caccount maintenance\u201d fee simply for holding your money?

{"title": "6 Ways to Save When Starting a Vet Clinic", "text": "Starting a veterinary practice can be a very expensive proposition, whether you are beginning from scratch or purchasing an existing business. An article in Veterinary Practice News estimated that the cost of starting a clinic (and purchasing the necessary equipment) clocks in somewhere around a million dollars. This can be a huge obstacle for those in the veterinary profession, as it is quite common for veterinarians to incur significant student debt while pursuing their DVM degree. It can be daunting to take on another large debt while trying to pay off educational loans.Fortunately, it is possible to cut costs to some extent when starting a new practice. Here are some of the best ways to save money when starting a veterinary clinic:Partner with Other VeterinariansStarting a solo veterinary practice from scratch is the most expensive option out there. It is much more affordable if you spread the cost between two (or more) partners. It is possible to go out on your own, but it is wise to consider distributing the risk in partnership with others in a similar situation.Seek Out Low-Cost LoansThere are several loan programs designed specifically for veterinary professionals, such as the one offered by Wells Fargo that is endorsed by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA). There are many options out there with varying rates and time frames, so you should be able to find a suitable arrangement with a little research.Consider the Mobile Clinic OptionThe start up cost for a mobile veterinary clinic is significantly less than that of a traditional veterinary clinic. A well outfitted mobile clinic, including the modified van and necessary equipment, can be purchased for about a quarter of the cost of a traditional clinic. The mobile option allows you to eliminate some big ticket overhead costs like rent and property taxes.Create a Realistic Budget and Stick to ItEvery responsible business owner needs to create a detailed budget as a part of their comprehensive business plan. This is particularly important for veterinary practice owners undertaking a major financial burden. It is critical that you determine what you can afford and stick to those numbers.Shop Around for the Best Prices or Use Group Purchasing OrganizationsIt is important that you research the cost of equipment and inventory to be sure you do not overpay for these items. Web searches can be very helpful in this regard. Group purchasing organizations (GPOs) have become increasingly common in veterinary circles in recent years, and they create strategic alliances to increase the purchasing power of independent practitioners and handle vendor negotiations.  GPOs often claim to save members between 10 and 20 percent on purchases. Be sure to check the terms of membership or access with regard to group purchasing organizations, however, as their costs can vary widely from one organization to the next.Don\u2019t Overstock in Terms of InventoryBe sure that you only purchase quantities that you can realistically use or sell in a given period of time. You don\u2019t want to be throwing away money on large quantities of expired prescriptions and medical supplies. Order a reasonable amount of stock to minimize losses on product spoilage. Gauging the correct amount should become easier over time as the clinic establishes a core client base and a pattern of product demand.Final WordStarting a veterinary practice is a huge financial undertaking, and veterinarians who choose this path should try to save money where it is possible for them to do so. Consider your options and opportunities carefully to ensure that your practice will be poised for success."}
{"title": "Tips for Putting Together Your Short Sale Package", "text": "Back in the old days -- like early 2006 -- short sale sellers and their agents were delivering a short sale package to the bank via FedEx or some other overnight express service. That's because banks would routinely lose or accidentally shred a faxed short sale package. Some banks outsourced this part of the short sale to foreign contract labor overseas. It was a nightmare, to say the least.As a result, some banks turned to online software management. In a Bank of America short sale, for example, among others, all offers are uploaded online, with the exception of certain types of HAFA short sales. Bank of America was a pioneer. But many banks still prefer to receive documents the old-fashioned way, via a fax machine. It's best just to ask before submitting your short sale package.Documents Required for a Short Sale PackageA few banks have streamlined the process for submitting a short sale package. These banks might send you their own documents with a bank logo, but it's not always necessary to complete them, so verify. Following is a list of documents that are generally required by all the banks for short sale submission: An Executed Listing AgreementThe bank wants to see when the property came on the market, the name of the brokerage that listed it, the term of the listing and the amount of the commission. It is generally not a good idea to send an offer that is considerably lower than the list price if the home has been the market for only a few days. Banks are not stupid. Fully Executed Purchase ContractNot every bank will accept a purchase contract that has been signed electronically. You might need \"wet\" signatures on the contract. An incomplete contract can cause delays. Make sure the property address is noted in its entirety, every spot to initial is initialed, and the contract is dated and signed by all parties, including, if necessary, by the real estate agents. Seller's Hardship LetterThe hardship letter is perhaps the most important part of the short sale package. It needs to tell the story about how the sellers got into their present situation, what they have done to find a solution and why there are no solutions apart from a short sale presently available. It must contain the loan number, and be signed and dated. Authorization LetterSome agents send the authorization letter with the short sale package and some prefer to submit the letter upon listing inception. This letter is signed by the sellers and authorizes the bank to speak with the listing agent. Without an authorization letter, the real estate agent cannot negotiate a short sale. Last 2 Bank StatementsAll bank statements, for every bank account are required for submission. Front and back. If there are large deposits or withdrawals on those statements, you may want to include a separate explanation because the processor will most likely wonder about it. Answer the question before it is asked. Last 2 Tax ReturnsSubmit as part of your short sale package, your federal tax returns for the last 2 years, signed and dated, every schedule and every single page. If you have not filed your tax returns for the past 2 years, you will need to include a letter of explanation and extensions. Last 2 W2'sYour last two years' of W2s will disclose your salary as reported by your employer to the IRS. If you are self employed, you will probably need to send 1099s and a profit and loss statement. Last two payroll stubsRegardless of how you are paid, whether it is monthly, weekly or bi-monthly, submit your last two payroll stubs. If you received a bonus or any other unusual increase of salary, you may want to include a note that explains this sudden increase. An Estimated HUD-1The HUD-1 is an estimated closing statement that is generally prepared by a closer or an escrow officer. It contains the property address, sellers' names, buyers' names and estimated closing date. I use a closing date that is at least 3 months away. Each cost of sale is a separate line item on the HUD. Because the HUD was revamped in 2011, some closers send a worksheet so the bank can understand the HUD. A HUD is not a simple document.Additional Documents for Your Short Sale PackageIf you have reason to believe the sales price might be rejected or countered by the bank, you may want to ask your real estate agent to include a comparable market analysis or CMA with your short sale package. The CMA should justify the sales price.If the home needs repair, include a minimum of 3 repair estimates. Realize, of course, that the bank will choose the lowest repair estimate."}
{"title": "What Is Nominal Debt?", "text": "Nominal debts have not been adjusted for factors like inflation. It refers to the current value of the debt.\n\nMoney has no value until it changes hands\n\nSignificance\n\nWhen looking at how much a debt eventually will cost, you need to consider other factors. For example, the true cost of a mortgage must factor in inflation, tax deduction benefits and home appreciation.\n\nReal debt value\n\nThe real value of a debt reflects external factors.\n\nNominal debt example\n\nLet's say you borrow $100 at 10 percent interest to be paid in a year. At the end of a year, the nominal value of that loan is $110. The lender made a $10 profit.\n\nReal debt example\n\nUsing that same example, let's say the annual inflation rate was 3 percent. That means your $100 was worth $103 at year's end. You pay the lender $110 according to the terms of the loan, which means that once the debt is adjusted for its real value of $103, the lender actually made $7. His real return was 7 percent, not 10 percent.\n\nFactors\n\nMarket forces, alternative costs and overhead are examples of additional factors that affect real value."}
{"title": "Part-Time Employment Taxes", "text": "If you have a second income from a part-time job you need to pay special attention to its effects on your federal income tax return, even though employers deduct tax withholding from checks you receive. Those moonlighting as an independent contractor are responsible for watching their own tax withholding and in addition may also be liable for self employment taxes if income exceeds a certain threshold. Check with your tax adviser for guidance on self employment taxes and mandatory tax withholding.\n\nHaving a part-time job directly affects your income tax return.\n\nTax Witholding for a Part-Time Job\n\nIncreasing the withholding on your W-4 can help you avoid underpayment of taxes .\n\nIf you receive income from a part-time job, you should pay attention to your W-4 tax withholding with your part-time employer to ensure enough taxes are being withheld. Increasing the withholding on your W-4 can help you avoid underpayment of taxes during the year and having a large balance due when you file your return. The taxes will be reduced from your regular paycheck and credited to you on your tax return when you file.\n\nIndependent Contractor Status\n\nIf you sell goods on commission, you may be considered an independent contractor.\n\nSome part-time jobs classify you as an independent contractor. If this is the case you will need to track and pay taxes separately. An example of a part-time independent contractor would be someone who is a direct commission seller of consumer goods. If the independent contractor makes more than $400 in a year they would receive a 1099 MISC form from the company that includes all sales commissions. The independent contractor would be responsible for paying employment taxes, which are for social security and medicare, in addition to the regular income tax rate. Currently the self-employment tax is 13.3 percent for the 2011 tax year.\n\nIndependent Contractor Tax Withholding Strategies\n\nTrack your total income and withholding in order to adjust your W-4.\n\nThose considered an independent contractor in their part-time jobs have an advantage if they already withhold taxes from their paycheck with their full-time employer. If independent contractors expect to pay less than $1,000 in self-employment taxes at the end of the year, the Internal Revenue Service states an independent contractor can increase their W-4 withholding from their regular employer in order to meet the quarterly withholding requirement for self-employed individuals.\n\nQuarterly Withholding for Independent Contractors\n\nKeep good records to help you estimate quarterly taxes.\n\nIf an independent contractor does not have an employer that withholds taxes, they may be required to pay quarterly estimated taxes on IRS Form 1040 ES. For those in this situation, the IRS states that a taxpayer must pay current year quarterly estimated tax if they expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax for the current year, or if they expect their withholding and credits to be less than their projected tax owed. Check with your tax adviser to see if you are required to complete Form 1040 ES."}

{"title": "The Top 4 Reasons Sellers Reject Offers From Home Buyers", "text": "Rejected offers cause home buyers considerable disappointment and enormous heartache. A seller doesn't have to rip the buyer's offer in half for buyers to feel like their hearts have been ripped out. All a seller has to say is \"NO,\" and your offer is rejected.Here are the top four reasons purchase offers are rejected:Offer Rejection Reason #1: Price is Way Too LowSellers can easily feel insulted. If a buyer offers too little, the seller might believe the buyer is not a serious buyer.The seller may be too angry to respond and, therefore, will reject the offer outright.If the house has just come on the market and is a fresh listing, the seller might feel it's too early to look at less-than-list offers.In most states, sellers are not required to respond to offers less-than-list price but agents are required to deliver them. Offer Rejection Reason #2: Selling Agent is a JerkScoff as you may but this can be a serious problem. Agents who possess the social graces of a chimp should have their real estate licenses suspended because nobody wants to deal with them. Agents without manners are wasting their time and making their buyer's lives unknowingly miserable. If a selling agent annoys the listing agent, especially during a multiple offer situation, it reflects poorly on that agent's buyer. Make sure your agent doesn't commit any of these sins:Screams or raises voice on the phone or in personForgets to say please or thank you Makes demands and issues ultimatumsInsults the listing agent by printing out comparable sales or market data, inferring the listing agent is stupid or ignorant (even if it's true) Maintains a demeaning attitudeApproaches the listing agent in an aggressive or pushy mannerDoes not display professionalismThere is nothing to prevent a listing agent from taking two identical offers to a seller and saying, \"I don't like Agent A, but Agent B is professional. Choose which offer you want.\" Most sellers given those circumstances will choose the offer from Agent B. Don't ever forget that this is a networking business; being polite and respectful earns kudos many times over. Don't let your agent sabotage your chances from the get-go. If it's not the price, often it's the agent.You would hope this doesn't happen in real estate yet it happens every single day. Offer Rejection Reason #3: Listing Agent Represents Competing BuyerA little known practice among consumers is the variable or dual-rate commission discussion that listing agents sometimes specify and negotiate into listing agreements. What this means is the listing agent makes an agreement with the seller that if the listing agent ends up also representing the buyer, the listing agent will reduce her commission (because she's earning both sides of the commission).For example, if the listing agent is charging a traditional real estate commission, and perhaps paying the selling broker a bit less, she might agree to knock a percentage point off the commission if she represents both sides of the transaction. It's called a variable rate. Therefore, if your own agent writes an offer, the seller will pay more and net less. Ask your agent to check MLS to see if the commission is variable. If so, your agent might be willing to match terms to get you the house.This does not mean that you need to call the listing agent to see the house. Offer Rejection Reason #4: Buyer Did Not Meet Seller's Specific NeedsSelling agents should always call a listing agent to find out if the seller has any specific requirements or hot buttons. Sometimes listing agents include helpful hints in the agent remarks portion of the MLS. If so, write them into the offer.If the seller needs a long escrow, offer a longer closing date.If the seller wants to see a substantial earnest money deposit, increase the deposit.Sometimes the financing terms stated in MLS are not met. For example, if the seller will accept only cash offers, don't expect an offer with FHA terms to get accepted.If the seller is concerned about repairs, offer to buy the property \"as is,\" after providing for a home inspection.Maybe it's a lender's preapproval letter that the seller wants; the point is you can't know how to satisfy the seller's demands if you don't ask.At the time of writing, Elizabeth Weintraub, CalBRE #00697006, is a Broker-Associate at Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, California."}
{"title": "What's the real cost of a college education?", "text": "Every college student learns one lesson quickly: College is expensive. According to a report by the College Board released last year, the average annual cost at a four-year public college was $11,354 and a year at a private college was $27,516. And it certainly isn't any cheaper this year.\nScholarships and grants don't make all the bills go away, either. Even after the average $3,300 in scholarships, a student at that four-year public school is looking at an annual tab of $8,054. And after his private-school cousin gets her average of $9,400 in scholarships, she's still got $18,116 to shoulder. \"Students and parents are borrowing a significant amount of money,\" says Sandy Baum, senior policy analyst with the College Board. In addition to federal education loans such as Stafford and PLUS, they are also turning to home equity loans and private lenders. Karlyn Wegmann is one of those parents. Her oldest child entered a private college last fall but didn't qualify for any financial aid. \"We were surprised because it's expensive, $36,000 a year,\" she says. \"But then they told us that if you make over $125,000, you're not going to get anything.\" Wegmann is a florist and grad student herself, and her husband is a pediatrician. They've lived in the same house 13 years. \"We don't drive a big, fancy car and don't have a home on the lake or a cabin,\" she says. \"I've never flown first-class and neither has my husband.\" While they paid the first year out of savings, for sophomore year they're tapping the home equity. By the time their third child graduates, \"there will be zero equity left in the house, it will have all been taken for tuition,\" she says. \"And we have a lot of friends who are doing the same thing.\" Students are getting loans, too. \"Students are increasingly borrowing private loans through banks,\" says Baum. Randa Chappin graduated from American University this spring. She commuted to school and estimates the full tuition was $25,000 to $30,000 per year. Financial aid took care of \"about 70 percent,\" she says. For the rest, she did what a lot of students do: work. She combined jobs with work-study assignments and even took out one loan. \"At one point I had three different jobs,\" she says. Chappin lucked out, she says, by getting a really good financial aid adviser. Four years of mentoring from the DC College Access Program, or DC-CAP, \"really helped me through my journey.\" Still, it took \"a lot of persistence, a lot of determination.\" Money shouldn't be a barrier\nThe real tragedy is that some low-income kids are passing on a college education simply because of the price. \"There is a portion of college-qualified, low-income graduates who are not going on to college or are delaying college because of the financial burden,\" says Nicole Barry, deputy director for the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance. Each year, 400,000 low- and moderate-income high school grads who are qualified for college won't attend a four-year school within two years of graduating. Of those, about half won't attend any college at all within those two years, according to a 2002 report by the committee. Of 100 low-income eighth-graders, 16 will be fully qualified to attend a four-year college but financially unable to do so, according to 2005 statistics from the committee. advertisement replacecontent-tcm:8-21405 And the situation has been getting worse, Barry says."}
{"title": "Can I Cancel Purchase Contract Due To Flood Insurance Rate Hikes", "text": "Dear Real Estate Adviser,\nSince signing to buy a new home and working countless hours to prep for a move, I am wondering if should try to cancel the purchase contract, even if it means losing the $3,000 earnest deposit. I put the money down on a lakefront property, and flood insurance rates are about to increase dramatically in Florida \u2014 again! When I signed, I wasn\u2019t aware of this. Can the seller claim any other damages against me? This has made me depressed.\n\u2014 Gene V.\n\nDear Gene,\nCheer up, Geno, and open up that purchase contract to look for several potential exit points.\nLender may back out of deal\nFirst off, I\u2019m wondering what your lender has to say about this situation, assuming you weren\u2019t paying cash for the house. If there\u2019s a financing contingency in your contract and the bank determines the added expense makes the deal too risky and hence denies you the loan, you might be able to gracefully exit with your $3,000 intact.\nTo facilitate this, you can try telling the lender that you may not be able to live up to your mortgage obligations given these findings, and the lender may withdraw approval.\nHurricanes to blame for rate hikes\nIt looks like a hefty hike of around 20% in flood insurance rates in April will be followed by another one between 9% and 20% next year, say insurers. That\u2019s some serious coin.\nThese hikes stem from the struggling National Flood Insurance Program\u2019s whopping $23 billion deficit caused by Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. You should know, too, that some insurers are starting to impose coverage caps that stop well short of full catastrophic-loss coverage.\nYou\u2019d need to get the bank\u2019s mortgage denial in writing. If your due-diligence period has already expired, you may be stuck losing the earnest money if this is your only way out.\nRATE SEARCH: Ready to make an offer on a home? Compare mortgage rates on Bankrate today!\nOther exit points in purchase contract\nIf there\u2019s an inspection contingency and your inspector discovers a defect the seller won\u2019t fix or didn\u2019t disclose, you can likely back out with no fear of a lawsuit. If you\u2019ve already cleared the inspection period, this won\u2019t work.\nIf the seller\u2019s disclosure didn\u2019t mention flood-insurance issues, that\u2019s a possible exit for you, too.\nAnother one would be possible if your contract has a condition that the property must appraise for at least its sales price \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t.\nBy the way, both the lender and your agent, if you\u2019re using one, should have known to inform you of the pending flood-insurance rate hike before you signed. Your agent may have neglected to do this to put his or her interests first, perhaps after watching other deals crater for the same reason.\nFollow your instincts, even if you lose money\nIf you\u2019ve already released your contingencies after passing a certain date, you may be stuck losing the earnest money. While the sellers can try to claim additional damages, they\u2019ll probably settle for the $3,000. If not, you may need to speak with a real estate attorney.\nYour gut instinct seems to be telling you to cut and run, and I\u2019m never comfortable suggesting that people buy something they\u2019re not wholly happy with.\nIf you really have the financial wherewithal to buy waterfront property in Florida, then that earnest money sum and any fees paid (inspection, title search, surveying, etc.) may be small compared with the peace of mind you\u2019ll have.\nGood luck!\nRATE SEARCH: Thinking about refinancing your mortgage?

{"title": "Sell More Books by Engaging Book Clubs: How to Get Them Interested", "text": "You can sell more books by engaging book clubs \u2014 if you're lucky enough to get onto their radar screens.Being popular with book clubs has \"made\" a number of books into bestsellers \u2014 but for those of us who have been professional book marketers, they are notoriously difficult to promote books to.Learn all about book clubs and get some tips about utilizing their book marketing potential.Due Diligence Definition \u2014 What Is a Book Club?Book clubs \u2014 aka \"book groups\" or \"reading groups\" \u2014 are a gaggle of people who all read the same book and then discuss it.Within those parameters are many variations \u2014 book clubs that read around a theme and those who pick what looks good to them; book groups that meet in person and those that \"discuss\" virtually in an online forum; readers groups that are self-organized and those that are \"assembled\" by another entity, such as a bookstore, library, or newspaper.Why Book Clubs Are Great for Book Marketing and Book SalesThere are a number of reasons why it pays to engage book clubs: Book clubs mean multiple copy sales. Sure, a couple of folks might share a copy or check the book out from the library \u2013 but many book club members like to own copies of the books that they've read. Book clubs create exponential word of mouth. Heck, the definition of the club is that they talk about your book \u2014 and generally discussion breeds more discussion and more general awareness of your book. Book clubs are comprised of avid readers. And what more privilege and joy can an author ask for than to have his or her book discussed by a passionate group of readers?The Challenges of Reaching Book GroupsIn most cases, book clubs are still \"grass roots.\" They aren't centrally organized and they operate largely by word of mouth. Further, while some groups can boast being together for years or even decades, many others don't survive that long.These hard-to-pin-down qualities mean that there isn't any easily accessible master list of reading groups that's been corralled for book marketing purposes.Book groups remain difficult to ferret out and mostly un-exploitable by those who seek to manipulate the book market. But the fact that reading groups are difficult to access en masses is also precisely what makes book groups such a valuable, and authentic resource for authors.To Market Your Book to Reading Groups, Go Where the Readers GoBecause there's no centralized place where an author or book marketing pro can find all of them, getting to reading groups is largely a process of them discovering you. In order to do that, you and your book need to \"go\" where the book clubs congregate and where they find their books.Access your own \"online\" and \"offline\" social circles. Spread the word that you'd love to \"connect\" with any friends and family book clubs. Use these connections as market research \u2013 what kind of books do they read? Do they invite guest authors?Start local. Inquire at your nearby bookstores (who may offer discounts for volume book club sales) and public library branches. Depending on your book's subject matter, think hard about \"affinity\" groups in non-traditional circumstances. For example, I know of local parenting support organization that hosts a monthly book club meeting around parenting books. Meetup.com can be a great resource for finding these groups.Explore online reading groups. Not all book clubs meet physically in person. Goodreads, LibraryThing \u2013 These resources with millions of readers Reading Group Choices \u2013 This website provides regular reading advice through newsletters and guides that are distributed to libraries, bookstores, book festivals, etc.Make Sure Your Book Has Ready \"Club Appeal\"According to famous librarian Nancy Pearl, unreliable narrators and ambiguous endings make for good book club picks. But whatever your book is about, you can craft great reading group discussions. Make your book club push in paperback. Many book clubs are price-sensitive so if your book comes out first in hardcover, it makes sense to save any major book club marketing efforts for the paperback\u200b book launch. And any digital or paperback versions also gives you the opportunity to include a reading group guide. Create one-sheet to distribute to bookstores and libraries on how your book is great for groups. Describe the book, offer social proof (reviews, quotes), and list the support materials (such as reading group guide and meeting recipes) and / or giveaways (bookmarks?) that are available to those groups who read the book. Add \"club appeal\" to social media efforts. Make \"great for book groups\" a prominent part of your social media marketing campaign. Make sure your descriptions are compelling (naturally) and indicate that the book would be good for reading groups. Get and circulate social proof such as reviews or quotes. If people in your network have been so kind as to review your book, hint to them that, if they agree it would be good for book clubs, you'd love it if they mentioned that fact in their review. Provide a reader's group guide in the book itself. Also called a book club discussion guide, it's a list of thoughtful questions to help spur discussions (see more on that, below). If you can't put one in the back of the paperback or digital book itself, add the PDF to your website.Hints for Developing a Reading Group GuideCreate open-ended questions. \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers stop discussions cold. Instead, consider inquiries such as, \"What did you like about the protagonist?\" \"What was your favorite passage and why?\" \"What did you find most shocking about [character's] actions?\"Consider \"ancillary\" book group materials. Thematic menu suggestions (or cocktail recipes!) for book group get-togethers.Give Something Away Hold a Goodreads giveaway. To raise awareness in that venue, where millions of readers congregate. Hold a contest for one or more virtual book group visits. Thanks to digital video technology, authors can virtually visit book groups (children's authors and YA authors often visit classrooms virtually). Since you won't incur travel expenses for the effort, get your Skype or Google Hangout skills in order (it's not that difficult) and run a contest on your author or book Facebook page. Offer an inexpensive promotional item. Or one \"nicer\" item as a raffle item. There's goodwill in a useful giveaway \u2013 a bookmark, a magnet, promotionally imprinted Post-It notepads.\"Recirculate\" Your Book Club SuccessesIf you've cracked a book group or two \u2014 congratulations! Now take that success and capitalize and build on it:Ask for book group feedback and get permission to post favorable quotes on your book's Facebook page and your author website.Ask for book groups to take pictures of their discussion that features your book and post on your blog, Facebook page or author website.Recount your book club experiences in a blog or Facebook post.If you're doing a public book club event (such as at a bookstore), help the organizer promote it \u2013 Tweet, retweet, blog, etc., the date and time.As a book club is likely to invite you only once for a certain book, share the wealth by recommending other authors to book clubs with whom you have a successful relationship."}

Plus, you'll get a 0% introductory APR for 15 months on balance transfers for each balance transfer made within 45 days of account opening. After that a variable APR will apply, 15.74%, 20.74% or 25.74%, based on your creditworthiness. Please note, there is a fee for balance transfers No annual fee\n\nHere\u2019s why you might want to get this card:\nIt comes with a 5% redemption bonus. About one in five consumers didn\u2019t redeem any credit card rewards last year, according to a NerdWallet study. If you don\u2019t always make time to cash in, the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae\u2019s redemption bonus might give you some motivation to do so. You can redeem a minimum of $50 in cash-back rewards for a gift card, statement credit or a deposit into your bank account.\nYou get a sign-up bonus and a 0% APR promotion. In addition to fair rewards, the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae offers a 0% APR promotion: 0% on Purchases for 15 months and 0% on Balance Transfers for 15 months (on balance transfers made within 45 days of account opening), and then the ongoing APR of 15.74%, 20.74% or 25.74% Variable APR. If you\u2019re paying off a large purchase, or plan to carry a balance in the first year, this benefit could save you hundreds on interest. The card also offers a modest sign-up bonus: Get a $200 cash rewards bonus after you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days after account opening.\nYou\u2019ll get a free FICO score online. Barclaycard will also send you alerts when your score changes.\nThe card offers travel protections, including trip cancellation and interruption insurance. If you pay for your travel with this card, you can get your nonrefundable traveling costs reimbursed if you have to change your plans because of sickness, severe weather or other covered events. Such benefits aren\u2019t available on most other cash-back cards.\nBarclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae: Pitfalls and other possibilities\nThe Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae might not be the best choice for you. Here\u2019s why:\nIt doesn\u2019t offer the highest flat-rate cash-back rewards rate. The Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae\u2019s effective earn rate of 1.575% is better than the run-of-the-mill 1.5% rewards many cash-back cards offer, but it\u2019s not the best flat-rate cash-back card around.\nAs of this writing, that title goes to the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offer , which offers an unlimited 1% cash back on all purchases, and another 1% cash back on every dollar you pay off. Like the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae, it also comes with a free FICO score, trip cancellation insurance and an annual fee of $0. As long as your credit\u2019s in good shape, you might be better off applying for a card that delivers more rewards.\nYou need excellent credit to qualify. If you have good-not-great credit, you might have a better chance qualifying for the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card. It comes with a similar 1.5% cash-back rewards and a nearly identical sign-up bonus: One-time $100 cash bonus after you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months of approval. Like the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae, it offers a 0% APR promotion: 0% on Purchases and Balance Transfers for 9 months, and then the ongoing APR of 13.74% - 23.74% Variable APR. Even though the card doesn\u2019t require excellent credit, it offers good long-term value.\nYou can\u2019t redeem less than $50 at a time. Compared with other cash-back cards, the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae\u2019s $50 redemption minimum is relatively steep. The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card has no redemption minimum, which makes it easy to cash in on every last penny you earn, and the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offer\u2019s redemption minimum is $25.\nSign-up bonus aside, you\u2019d have to spend $3,334 on the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae before you could redeem your rewards. And while you\u2019d get a bonus for cashing in, you wouldn\u2019t be able to access it until you spent another $3,331.50. Frugal spenders might be better off with a different card.\nIs the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae right for you?\nIf you\u2019re a big spender, and you\u2019re looking for an extra incentive to redeem your cash-back rewards, the Barclaycard CashForward\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae might be an OK card for you. But before applying, consider cash-back cards with a higher rewards rate and more-flexible redemption options.\nLast updated April 20, 2016."}

{"title": "Can I Get a Tax Deduction for Low Flush Toilets?", "text": "Consumers who buy low-flush toilets, also referred to as low-flow toilets, can reap many cost savings, and that can include being able to receive certain tax deductions. Several rules govern tax deductions that the purchaser should know before buying this energy saving product.\n\nPurchasing low-flush toilets can help consumers save on utility bills, and reduce their taxable income.\n\nLow-Flush Toilets\n\nLow-flush toilets are designed to use the least amount of water possible when they are flushed. Federal laws aimed at water conservation require toilet manufacturers to design all toilets made after 1994 so that they use no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush. That compares to the toilet's predecessor that used up to 7 gallons of water per flush. Because the newer toilets use less water, they are more energy efficient.\n\nTax Deductions\n\nTax deductions, whether they are assessed at the local, state or federal level, can help taxpayers reduce the amount of their income that is subject to tax. No tax deductions specifically cover the purchase of low-flush toilets. An example of an eligible tax deduction is the interest a taxpayer pays on their mortgage or student loan.\n\nHome Improvement Tax Deductions\n\nTax deductions are not available specifically for the purchase of low-flush toilets, however taxpayers may not be completely out of luck. Homeowners who purchase low-flush toilets as a part of a project that helps them increase their energy savings may be able to take advantage of the home improvement tax deduction. This means that a bathroom home improvement project that includes a low-flush toilet could result in a tax deduction.\n\nHome Repair vs. Home Improvements\n\nConsumers who decide to replace a broken toilet with a low-flush toilet should understand that the purchase may not qualify for a tax deduction. The IRS specifies that the purchase be solely for home improvements, not home repairs. Consumers should verify with the IRS whether their low-flush toilet purchase qualifies for a tax deduction. A professional tax advisor can also provide information for consumers considering a toilet purchase.\n\nDonations and Loans\n\nIf a taxpayer has leftover building materials from their home improvement project, he can donate the amount of material he has left over, and that amount may be tax deductible.\n\nAlso, homeowners who take out home equity loans or lines of credit to finance their home improvement projects may be able to deduct the interest paid on the loans from their income taxes. To verify if they can make this deduction, consumers should contact a professional tax advisor before completing their tax returns."}
{"title": "Elements of a Strong Speaker Evaluation Form", "text": "Anyone who is working on an educational program recognizes that it\u2019s important to develop a speaker evaluation form to measure the effectiveness of the overall program or an individual break out session. This is something that challenges meeting and event planners, and it\u2019s a step that many would like to overlook.However, a good speaker evaluation form can be used as an important tool to measure the effectiveness of a given program, and it can be used as a tool the measure the contribution that a meeting has on an organization\u2019s objectives.Perhaps the biggest challenge associated with creating a speaker evaluation form is to format it so that it\u2019s easy to complete. Although most attendees expect to complete an evaluation, it\u2019s helpful to remember that they are usually more interested in leaving a session immediately when it concludes.Recognizing this challenge, provide some sort of incentive to have attendees complete the form. This is an opportunity for the planner to have some fun and reinforce the company, and may include promotional items from the organization or even gift certificates.Elements of a Speaker Evaluation FormThe most important item that meeting planners should consider when developing a speaker evaluation form is the importance of keeping the form brief (one page). Some tips include:Provide clear, brief instructions at the top.List the session name and speaker on the form.Measure the effectiveness in a maximum of five options.Ask if the session objectives were met.Ask if the session was perceived as valuable.Ask an open ended question for more information.Keep the form optionally anonymous.Ask if there\u2019s any interest in follow up contact.To be sure, feedback on evaluation forms will be subjective, as the comments are based on many personal factors of who is responding.For example, those who attend a given program will likely be at different levels of professional experience with a given topic, and that will impact how they respond. Their feedback may also vary based on different expectations of a program before attending.Sample Speaker Evaluation FormThe National Speakers Association (NSA), Tempe, AZ, has developed a speaker evaluation form template that it uses at meetings to evaluate its own educational sessions.\u201cWe ask the all of our speakers provide us with learning outcomes for their sessions, which we print in the program with our session descriptions, explains Marsha Mardock, NSA spokesperson. \u201cThen we ask our attendees to measure the success of the session against the learning outcomes.\u201dSpecific questions include:Please rate how well this session\u2019s learning objectives were met?What value did you receive from this session?What is the best idea you heard in this session that you plan to use?NSA was established in 1973 and is a leading organization for professional speakers, providing resources and education designed to advance the skills, integrity and value of the speaking profession.Summarize Session Evaluation Form Results Once the evaluation forms are collected, event organizers should compile the results into a report that summarizes all the results. This includes information about speaker ratings in the various categories measured, as well as the comments themselves.Such reports are used to measure how effectively a seminar or conference session met the needs of the audience, and what may be improved in the future. Motivational speaker Pegine Echevarria of Team Pegine Inc., Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, suggests that meeting planners tally results into a report called an After Action Report (see sample).\u201d\u2019We learned this from the military,\u201d Pegine explains. \u201cEveryone in the Army writes an After Action Report to share with their superiors, including what worked, what didn\u2019t and solutions for improvement after each project or task. We provide the same. The reports include not only the audience results but information from my speaking & consulting experience.\u201dAfter Action ReportThis report provides more information than a speaker session evaluation. It\u2019s an evaluation of the program itself, including the planning process. Pegine provides an After Action Report after each speaking engagement. \u201cMy clients know about the report before each event and they love receiving it after, it is an added value to them.\u201d She answers questions for meeting planners, including:What did they do well?What could have been done differently?What ideas do I have for future events?Walter Reed Army Medical Center outlines its After Action Report guidelines for planning educational programs with speakers.

{"title": "What Does It Mean When a Bankruptcy Is Discharged?", "text": "Bankruptcies fall under federal jurisdiction in the United States. There are federal bankruptcy courts in every judicial district across the country. Federal law, the United States Bankruptcy Code, governs the substance of bankruptcy law. The Bankruptcy Code outlines what it means when a bankruptcy is discharged.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhen a bankruptcy court discharges a bankruptcy, the debtor will no longer be liable for qualified debts. In other words, discharge in bankruptcy means the debtor will not have to pay certain debts. Discharge mainly applies to unsecured debts, which are debts that have no underlying asset (like credit card debt, unlike a mortgage). Under some circumstances, a secured credit may continue to enforce a lien against a property securing the debt even after the court discharges the bankruptcy.\n\nPermanent Injunction\n\nA bankruptcy discharge acts as a permanent injunction that bars creditors from pursuing any further collection efforts. Creditors whose debts were discharged in the bankruptcy are not permitted to take legal action or communicate with the bankruptcy debtor. This means that those creditors cannot send letters or make harassing phone calls.\n\nNon-Dischargeable Debt\n\nCongress has enacted legislation that has created several categories of debt that are non-dischargeable. That means that there are certain types of debt that a bankruptcy court cannot discharge under any circumstances. The main categories for non-dischargeable debt are federal student loans, most taxes (federal, state and local), criminal fines, alimony and child support.\n\nDismissal\n\nDischarge is different than a dismissal. If a bankruptcy case is dismissed, the bankruptcy court will not order the creditors to forgive any debt. In addition, if a bankruptcy case is dismissed, rather than discharged, the creditors are free to restart all legal collection efforts.\n\nTiming\n\nTiming can vary as to when a bankruptcy court will discharge a bankruptcy. Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcies typically take about four months from the date the debtor files the bankruptcy petition before the court will discharge the bankruptcy. In Chapter 11, 12 and 13 cases, the court will typically grant the discharge once the debtor completes making payments on the approved payment plan. Those types of bankruptcies can take 3 to 5 years to discharge.\n\nWarning\n\nBankruptcy should only be pursued after carefully considering all options. Please consult a qualified attorney licensed to practice in the state in which you reside to find out if bankruptcy is right for you."}

{"title": "Define Composition Settlement", "text": "A composition settlement is a voluntary debtor-creditor agreement in which two or more creditors agree to accept less than the full amount due from a debtor. According to FindLaw.com, although a composition settlement is common in bankruptcy proceedings, it is also becoming a common tactic for paying a creditor without resorting to filing a formal bankruptcy petition.\n\nHow a Composition Settlement Works\n\nAlthough state laws vary, most consider composition settlements to be legal contracts. A debtor starts the process by submitting a composition contract offer to creditors. According to JRank.org, the offer typically includes a lump sum to be divided proportionally between the named creditors who accept the offer. In return for receiving at least some of the debt owed, creditors agree to accept less than the full amount due and mark the debt paid-in full. There is no standard form required to create a composition settlement and creditors who decline are not bound by it."}
{"title": "Word of Mouth vs. Viral Marketing: What&#39;s the Difference?", "text": "Word-of-mouth marketing or viral marketing? What's the difference? Recently I shared with you a few tips on how to generate word-of-mouth marketing for your business. I received a few emails as well as comment post on the difference between word-of-mouth marketing and viral marketing, so I figured what better time to explore the differences in these two types of marketing. Word-of-mouth marketing is when a business does something and their consumer tells five to ten friends. Word-of-mouth marketing has an echo affect. The initial sound is loud and then it fades into the background. Viral marketing unlike word-of-mouth marketing has a compounding affect. A consumer tells five to ten people and then those five to ten people tell another five to ten people. The driving force behind most viral campaigns is the passion a consumer carries. It's like a virus that continuously infects more people and spreads without requiring anymore marketing effort. While the two are similar as you can see they are not the same. Word-of-mouth marketing is a key component to the growth of a small business. It's often word-of-mouth marketing that keeps small businesses running in the early days of operation when there is little to no marketing budget. The consumer shares their experience with your products or services and they share it with their family and friends. This increases your consumer base and increases your sales. Viral marketing is more about reaching out and touching the passion point of your consumer, so that the passion drives the message and the message continues to reach the masses without assistance from you. You can orchestrate a viral campaign, but very seldom are viral campaigns that are orchestrated as successful as those that are just driven by the passion of a consumer. In order for it to reach a level of success your consumer must feel they have a personal stake and investment in the success of your campaign. It's important to also realize that the success of a viral campaign depends on the vehicles use to transmit the message. There are companies that are more virally equipped than others. In order to create a strong viral link the message must be able to transport from television advertising, to radio and other extended means of broadcasting to the power of the Internet.  Let's take a look at a few examples: Word of Mouth Marketing Examples Starbucks \u2013 Starbucks depends on word of mouth for their marketing, you will find that they avoid the transactional advertising in favor of word of mouth marketing.   They invest in their social media programs to further the word of mouth push and encourage customers to comments and share.  Red Bull \u2013 You'll see very little when it comes to advertising when it comes to Red Bull, they focus more on driving word of mouth through event marketing.  One prime event that does well for them is the Red Bull Wings Team.  This group drives around in Red Bull brand vehicles sharing sampels of Red Bull. Coca-Cola \u2013 Remember the HillTop ad that Coca Cola did? If not, perhaps the lyrics will spark a memory - \"I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke.\"  Is the song stuck in your head?  This jingle had the whole world singing and if that weren't enough it was recently revisted on the Mad Man series that had everyone humming it again.  The song spoke of unity and tolerance and as consumers we gravitated to it and shared it.  Viral Marketing Examples Mad Men Yourself \u2013 Speaking of Mad Men during the third season of Mad Men they worked to create buzz through an application called Mad Men Yourself.  The application as an avatar creator that helped you to create an avatar that made a 60s stylized version of yourself.  The site received over half a million visitors the first week.   After five years you can still use the application and it's going strong.  Dove \u2013 Choose the Beautiful -  This was a campaign that showed a viral video of a woman walking through a revolving door that said either \"average\" or \"beautiful.\"  This campaign appealed to the emotion of women, it was relatable and women shared it.  In the process it taught the meaning of \"true beauty.\" It wasn't about advertising product, it was about sharing a message everyone could relate to.    In conclusion the major different between word-of-mouth marketing and viral is that word-of-mouth is often driven by you the marketer or business owner and viral marketing driven by the passion of your consumers and it's success does not depend on you."}
{"title": "5 Resume Tips for Municipal Job Seekers", "text": "The month, date and year of start and end dates are not necessary; however, the month and year allow the reviewer to ascertain a more precise time an applicant spent in a position. It's very likely that a public sector employer is going to check these dates, so be sure they are accurate.If an individual has worked in multiple positions within the same company, each position should be documented separately. This gives a better view of the duties that were performed for each position. Even if the positions are similar, point out the differences; which could include an increase in responsibility or promotion to a new pay grade.The experience listed in a resume should include detailed statements of duties, such as \"Created curriculum for training courses; produced handouts, slideshows, and exercises; introduced trainees to the policies and procedures for giving performance evaluations.\"You want to be as clear as possible about exactly how much and what kind of work you did.By listing a description of each past employer on your resume, a future employer can get an idea of the environment in which you performed previous duties.Some details you'll probably want to include are the size of the organization, whether it was private or public sector, and how working there qualified you for the job for which you are applying. Just be sure that if you don't want your current employer to be contacted that you make it clear in your application. Especially within the public sector, employers that are able to count volunteer experience and unpaid internships as qualifying work experience. Even for those who are unable to count unpaid experience as qualifying, it allows them to get an entire picture of an applicant's acquired knowledge, skills, and abilities.When detailing volunteer or internship experience, include the same information you would for a paid position.

{"title": "What to do about a lost ATM card", "text": "Smart consumers are careful to keep track of their cash and plastic cards that function as money. But suppose a wallet gets lost or stolen with a bank ATM card tucked away, seemingly safe inside. While some people might be tempted to wait and hope the wallet turns up intact, the wiser course is to take immediate action.\nHere\u2019s what to do.\nReport the loss\nThe loss or theft of an ATM card should be reported as quickly as possible, according to George Joseph, president and CEO of Dade County Federal Credit Union in Miami. Most banks have a toll-free customer service phone number for this purpose.\n\u201cAs soon as you know it\u2019s missing, you should notify your bank or credit union,\u201d Joseph says. \u201cYou need to do that immediately.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to send a follow-up letter, with the account number and an explanation of when the loss was discovered and reported, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Unauthorized withdrawals or transfers also should be reported as soon as possible.\nLiability limits\nA consumer\u2019s potential liability due to a lost or stolen ATM card depends primarily on how soon the loss of the card is reported to the bank, according to the FTC.\nIf the loss is reported prior to any unauthorized activity, the potential liability is zero.\nIf the loss is reported within two business days of discovery, the potential liability is capped at $50.\nAfter two business days, that amount increases to $500.\nIf the loss isn\u2019t reported within 60 days after the bank sends out a statement, the consumer is responsible for all losses up to the balance of the account, plus the unused portion of any overdraft line of credit.\n\u201cBest-case scenario, they\u2019re not responsible for anything. Worst-case scenario, they\u2019re responsible for everything,\u201d Joseph says.\nSome banks will reduce or waive a customer\u2019s loss as a matter of goodwill, according to Cary Whaley, vice president of payments and technology policy at Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade association in Washington, D.C.\nA homeowners or renters insurance policy also may reimburse all or a portion of the loss, up to the policy limit, according to the FTC.\nNew ATM card\nMost banks offer replacement ATM cards at the local bank branch or by mail. Some provide free replacements; others charge a fee or allow customers a few free cards and then charge a fee for any more.\nCustomers who want to speed up delivery of a replacement ATM card usually have that option, according to Whaley.\n\u201cAlmost every bank that I\u2019m aware of has a process to expedite a replacement card. That may be for an additional fee, particularly if it involves something like Express Mail,\u201d he says.\nCustomers who lose multiple ATM cards may be encouraged to use other banking services, such as paper checks or an ATM card that doesn\u2019t include a credit or debit capability and carry a higher risk of loss, Whaley says. This type of ATM card could only be used to get cash or make deposits.\nIn the most severe cases, a customer may be cut off from ATM cards altogether. \u201cIt really depends on how much risk the bank or credit union is willing to take and how good of a customer you are,\u201d Joseph says.\nRegistration services\nPrivate companies known as registration services allow consumers to store and track credit, debit and ATM card numbers for a fee. Some of these companies will report lost cards and request replacements on the consumer\u2019s behalf, according to the FTC.\nWhether these services are worthwhile is a matter of opinion. Those who opt for such a service should compare offers and read the contract to find out what\u2019s included.\nWhether a bank will be willing to accept the word of a third party that purports to represent a banking customer is open to doubt.\n\u201cIf we get a call from someone saying one of our members lost their card and they want one reissued, we will tell them to take a hike,\u201d Joseph says. \u201cIt\u2019s only more of a nightmare for you than to do it yourself.\u201d\nPIN protection\nNo advice about ATM cards would be complete without a warning about PINs, or personal identification numbers. The chief caveat, often repeated and just as often ignored, is to keep the PIN private, even from the bank\u2019s employees. Storing a PIN in an online or mobile application is \u201can absolute no-no,\u201d Whaley says. Starting out with a replacement card after a loss or theft is a good opportunity to develop the habit of memorizing the PIN and keeping it safe and secret.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the major security you have, particularly for cash withdrawals,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t write it on the back of your card. Don\u2019t store it in your online wallet right next to your card number. \u2026 Don\u2019t tempt people.\u201d\nMore From Bankrate"}

{"title": "PMI - What Is Private Mortgage Insurance?", "text": "mortgage\nPrivate mortgage insurance, or PMI: Just the basics\n If your down payment on a home is less than 20%, you will have to pay for mortgage insurance. What is PMI? When you make a down payment of less than 20%, the lender requires private mortgage insurance, or PMI. The policy protects the lender from losing money if you end up in foreclosure. PMI also is required if you refinance the mortgage with less than 20% equity. Private mortgage insurance fees vary, depending on the size of the down payment and your credit score, from around 0.3% to about 1.5% of the original loan amount per year. Some years, PMI premiums are tax-deductible and some years they're not, depending upon the whim of Congress. RATE SEARCH: Find a low-down payment mortgage today. How mortgage insurance is calculated Peyton buys a $200,000 house and makes a 10% down payment, borrowing $180,000. Peyton has a 740 credit score.\n*Rate varies according to size of down payment, credit score and insurer. Insurance rate 0.41% per year* Loan amount $180,000 Annual premium $738 Monthly premium: $61.50 Source: Bankrate.com, Radian mortgage insurance calculator Most PMI policies require the borrower to pay monthly. Borrowers also have the option of paying for mortgage insurance with a large upfront payment.\nPMI can be canceled Your lender must automatically cancel PMI when your outstanding loan balance drops to 78% of the home's original value. This probably will take several years. You can speed up the cancellation of mortgage insurance by keeping track of your payments. Once the loan balance reaches 80% of the home's original value, you may ask the lender to discontinue the mortgage insurance premiums. To put it another way: You can request cancellation of mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio drops to 80%. The lender is required to cancel private mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio drops to 78%. Loan-to-value ratio The loan-to-value ratio, or LTV, describes mortgage debt as a percentage of how much the home is worth. It is a financial term used by lenders. Formula: Mortgage amount owed / Appraised value Example: Alex owes $60,000 on the mortgage. The house is worth $100,000. $60,000 mortgage balance / $100,000 = 0.60. This means that Alex's loan-to-value ratio is 60%. We're talking PMI, not FHA Recent FHA-insured loans require payment of mortgage insurance premiums for the life of the loan.

The unfortunate truth is that some retirement plans, though not all, can be lost to lawsuits.\n\nBusinessman studying his finances on his tablet\n\ncredit: LDProd/iStock/Getty Images\n\nERISA Accounts\n\nMost retirement plans that fall under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA, cannot be reached by a judgment creditor if you're sued. These plans include 401(k) benefits. One easy way to determine whether yours is an ERISA plan is to identify who set it up and maintains it. If it's your employer, it's probably an ERISA plan so it's safe. These retirement funds include anti-alienation clauses which prevent anyone but you from accessing the benefits. A few catches exist, however. ERISA accounts are vulnerable to lawsuits it you took action that harmed the plan or its administrator.

{"title": "Tax Deduction Definition", "text": "What is a tax deduction?\nA tax deduction reduces how much of a taxpayer's income is subject to tax.\nThe tax system gives a taxpayer a choice of adding up all his deductible expenses -- evidence to those expenses should be provided to the IRS -- or simply deducting a flat amount (standard deductions).\nDeductions lower a taxpayer's taxable income by the percentage of his or her highest federal income tax bracket.\nBreaking down tax deductions\nTaxpayers have the option of claiming a standard deduction or itemizing deductions. However, they cannot claim both in the same year. Many states that impose an income tax also allow taxpayers to claim a similar type of deduction on their state income tax return.\nStandard deductions\nThe standard tax deduction is a one-size-fits-all reduction in the amount of the taxpayer's income that is subject to tax. He doesn't have to do anything to be eligible for a standard deduction or provide any documentation.\nTaxpayers can claim the standard deduction on whichever form they file: Form 1040, 1040EZ or 1040A. The amount of their standard deduction typically depends on the filing status they qualify for. As of 2017, the amount of standard deduction was as follows:\n2017 Standard deduction amounts Single filers $6,350 Married couples filing separately $6,350 Married couples filing jointly $12,700 Heads of household $9,350 Surviving spouse $12,700\nItemized tax deductions\nItemizing deductions allow taxpayers to add up the entire amount they spent on allowable deductions, such as charitable donations, medical expenses or home mortgage interest.\nIf these expenses combine to exceed the value of the standard deduction, taxpayers can choose to itemize. They need to use the regular Form 1040 and Schedule A.\nIt is much easier to claim the standard deduction than to itemize, but it could cost you money. The IRS recommends that taxpayers take the time to run the numbers and determine which option gives them a bigger deduction.\nTax deduction increases\nThe federal income tax system increases the amount of the standard deduction for taxpayers who are 65 years old or older, blind or both.\nThe IRS allows blindness adjustment for individuals who are totally or partially blind. Partially blind taxpayers should include a certified statement from their physician, stating that they can't see better than 20/200 out of their better eye, even with contacts or eyeglasses, or that their field of vision is limited to 20 degrees or less.\nSpecial situations\nThere are some taxpayers who can't take the federal standard deduction. For example, if a taxpayer is married but files taxes separately and his spouse itemizes deductions on her return, then he cannot claim the standard deduction.\nTaxpayers also can't claim standard deductions if they (or their spouses, if filing jointly) were nonresident clients at any time during the fiscal year. Also, if the taxpayer changes his annual accounting period and files a tax return that covers less than a year, the standard deduction is unavailable.\nTax credit versus tax deduction\nBoth a tax credit and a tax deduction reduce tax bills but in very different ways. For instance, if taxpayers take advantage of a $1,000 tax deduction on $30,000 in taxable income, their taxable income is reduced to $29,000. The amount of money saved in this situation would be a small percentage of the $1,000 deduction.\nOn the other hand, a tax credit of the same amount would cut the amount of taxes owed by $1,000. The actual amount of savings realized is the entire $1,000, as tax credits reduce taxes dollar for dollar, while tax deductions do not."}

Not only are returns relatively predictable, but some of these securities have tax advantages, and they usually are less risky than, say, stocks.\nThe trade-off, of course, is that in lowering risk exposure, investors are likely to see lower returns over the long run. That may be fine if your goal is to preserve capital and maintain a steady flow of interest income. But if you\u2019re looking for growth, consider investing strategies that match your long-term goals.\nRATE SEARCH: Looking for a place to stash your cash? Compare CD rates today.\nRisk tolerance and time horizon play big roles in deciding how much to allocate to fixed income. Conservative investors or those near retirement may be more comfortable allocating a larger percentage of their portfolios to fixed income to minimize risk.

Because these are \u201ctime deposits,\u201d you cannot withdraw the money for a specified period of time without penalty. The financial institution pays you interest at regular intervals. Once the CD matures, you get your original principal back plus any accrued interest. There are several different types, including jumbo, callable and flexible CDs\nRATE SEARCH: Compare high-yield CD offers on Bankrate today.\nRisk: CDs are considered safe investments. However, they do carry reinvestment risk \u2014 the risk that when interest rates fall, investors will earn less when they reinvest principal and interest in new CDs with lower rates.\nConsider laddering CDs \u2014 investing money in CDs of varying terms \u2014 so that all your money isn\u2019t tied up in one instrument for a long time. Although CD returns often are higher than those of traditional savings accounts, it\u2019s important to note that inflation and taxes could significantly erode the purchasing power of your money.\nLiquidity: CDs aren\u2019t as liquid as savings accounts or money market accounts because you tie up your money until the CD reaches maturity \u2014 often for months or years. It\u2019s possible to get at your money sooner, but generally you\u2019ll pay a penalty.\nBankrate's best 1 year CD rates Each week, Bankrate scours the country in search of the best CD rates.

This type of account should not be confused with money market funds, which are mutual funds that normally are not FDIC-insured. MMAs typically earn higher interest than savings accounts and require higher minimum balances. In exchange for better interest earnings, consumers usually have to accept more restrictions on withdrawals, such as limits on how often you can access your money.\nRATE SEARCH: Looking for higher interest than a traditional savings account? Compare money market account offers today.\nRisks: If inflation rates exceed the interest rate earned on the account, your purchasing power could be diminished. In addition, you could lose some or all of your principal if your account is not FDIC-insured (although the vast majority are) or if you have more than the $250,000 FDIC-insured maximum in any one account.\nLiquidity: Federal regulations limit withdrawals to six per month (or statement cycle), of which no more than three can be check transactions.\nMoney market mutual funds\n\nHow they\u2019re valued: Money market mutual funds \u2014 also known as money market funds or MMFs \u2014 are a saving and investing option offered by banks, brokerages and mutual fund companies. MMFs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and are required to invest in short-term debt securities, such as certificates of deposits and U.S. Treasury bills. The funds have historically tried to maintain a share price of $1, but there\u2019s no guarantee a fund will be able to maintain the share price.\nRATE SEARCH: Compare money market account and savings rates at Bankrate.com today.\nRisks: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prohibits the average maturity of fund investments from exceeding 90 days. Restricting investments to such short terms helps reduce risk to the investor by protecting them from major rate fluctuations that may occur over longer periods. Interest rates can vary, so there\u2019s no guarantee of how much you\u2019ll earn from month to month. Further, there\u2019s no guarantee that the share price will remain stable at $1 per share. If the share price dips below $1, you could lose some of your principal. When a money market fund is unable to maintain a $1 NAV, it\u2019s known as \u201cbreaking the buck.\u201d This very rarely happens, although it has occurred recently as a consequence of the credit crisis.\nWhen investors redeem shares in money market funds, they are repaid at the fund\u2019s NAV calculated on the day the investors place the redemption order. Moreover, since money market funds are technically securities, they normally are not FDIC-insured, although some funds are temporarily protected.\nLiquidity: Money market funds, like money market accounts, often provide check-writing and money transfer privileges for shareholders.\nT-bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds\n\nHow they\u2019re valued: Treasury bills, or T-bills, are short-term debt instruments the U.S. government issues to raise money to pay for projects and pay its debts. Maturities of T-bills range from a few days to 52 weeks.\nT-bills technically are not interest-bearing. They are sold at a discount from their face value but when they mature, the government pays you full face value. For example, if you buy a $1,000 T-bill for $980, you would earn $20 on your investment.\nTreasury notes, or T-notes, are issued in terms of two, three, five, seven and 10 years and pay interest every six months until they mature. The price of a note may be greater than, less than or equal to the face value of the note, depending on demand. If demand by investors is high, the notes will trade at a premium, which effectively reduces investor return. Upon maturity, investors are paid its face value.\nTreasury bonds are issued with 30-year maturities and pay interest every six months. They are sold at auction four times a year: in February, May, August and November. The price and yield are determined at auction. Upon maturity, you are paid face value plus interest.\nAll three types of Treasury securities are offered in increments of $100.\nRisks: Treasury securities are considered virtually risk-free because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. You can count on getting interest and your principal back at maturity. However, the value of securities fluctuates, depending on whether interest rates are up or down. In a rising rate environment, existing bonds lose their allure because investors can get a higher return from newly issued bonds. Therefore, if you try to sell your bond before maturity, you may experience a capital loss.\nTreasuries also are subject to inflation pressures. If the interest rate of the security is not as high as inflation, investors lose purchasing power.\nBecause they mature quickly, the risk of holding T-bills is not as great as with longer-term T-notes or Treasury bonds.\nLiquidity: All Treasury securities are very liquid, but if you sell prior to maturity you may experience gains or losses, depending on the interest rate environment (see risks, above).\nRATE SEARCH: Let Bankrate help you find a brokerage account today.\nGovernment bond funds\n\nHow they\u2019re valued: Government bond funds are mutual funds that invest in debt securities the U.S. government and its agencies issue. The funds invest in debt instruments such as T-bills, T-notes, T-bonds and mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nRisks: Funds that invest in government debt instruments are considered to be among the safest investments because the securities are backed by the faith and credit of the U.S. government. However, like other mutual funds, the fund itself is not government-backed and is subject to risks \u2014 namely interest rate fluctuations and inflation. If interest rates rise, bond prices decline, and if interest rates decline, bond prices rise. Interest-rate risk is greater for long-term bonds. Further, if the inflation rate rises, purchasing power can be diminished.\nLiquidity: Bond fund shares are highly liquid, but their values fluctuate depending on the interest-rate environment.\nMunicipal bond funds\n\nHow they\u2019re valued: Municipal bond funds invest in a number of different municipal bonds, or munis, issued by state and local governments. Earned interest generally is free of federal income taxes and also may be exempt from state and local taxes.\nRisks: Individual bonds carry the risk of default, meaning the issuer becomes unable to make further income or principal payments. Cities and states don\u2019t go bankrupt often, but it can happen. Bonds also may be callable, meaning the issuer returns principal and retires the bond before the bond\u2019s maturity date. This results in a loss of future interest payments to the investor. Fortunately, bond funds spread out potential default and prepayment risks by owning a large number of bonds, thus cushioning the blow of negative surprises from a small part of the portfolio.\nLiquidity: You can buy or sell your fund shares every business day. In addition, you usually can reinvest income dividends and make additional investments at any time.\nShort-term corporate bond funds\n\nHow they\u2019re valued: Short-term corporate bond funds invest in bonds that corporations issue. Short-term bonds have an average maturity of one to five years.\nRisks: As is the case with other bond funds, short-term corporate bond funds are not FDIC-insured. Investment-grade short-term bond funds can reward investors with higher returns than munis or Treasuries. But along with the greater reward comes greater risk. There is always the chance that companies will have their credit rating downgraded or run into financial trouble and default on the bonds.\nLiquidity: You can buy or sell your fund shares every business day. In addition, you usually can reinvest income dividends and make additional investments at any time. However, it\u2019s possible to suffer capital losses.\nMore From Bankrate"}
{"title": "What Are Accounts Payable & Receivable?", "text": "It is sometimes difficult to track your money. However, with proper budgeting and recording, you can keep an accurate account of where your money is traveling each month, the people or companies you owe and what funds you are able to save. Whether you are a business or an individual, an understanding of accounts receivable and accounts payable is helpful.\n\nKnowing your accounts receivable and payable is part of responsible money management.\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nAccounts payable refers to a company's obligation to pay off a short-term debt to the person or company to which it owes money. It is also the department or division of a company that has the task of paying monies that the company owes its suppliers, the bank and other creditors, according to Investopedia. It denotes the short-term expenses the company intends to pay at a later date.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable is a way of extending credit to a customer. It involves the invoicing of that consumer or company for products or services you have rendered. On the invoice, you are placing the amount of money the individual or company owes you, and placing a time limit on when they must actually pay--whether in 30, 60 or 90 days.\n\nKeeping Accurate Ledgers\n\nSometimes money flows in and out so rapidly that it is hard to keep up with what monies are coming in, and what is leaving your account. For this reason, keeping an accurate ledger becomes important. As the Business Owner's toolkit suggests, you should keep such a record for each customer. As soon as that person or business pays, you record it in the ledger.\n\nKeep all records of receipts, as well as ledgers you do by hand, in a safe place. If you are a business, you will need that information to give to your accountant should there be an audit.\n\nHousehold Accounts Payable\n\nAccounts payable can also refer to household accounts. According to Investopedia, personal accounts payable involves bills, such as utility invoices. This includes expenses such as rent, electricity, gas, cable and telephone. You must pay these expenses every month, and as is the case for businesses, you should keep a record of monthly expenses, so that you may construct your budget for next month accordingly."}

It's great if you know how to use them. But if you don't, credit can make school -- and your life after -- a lot more difficult.\nThe average senior graduates with about $3,000 in credit card debt, according to recent data from student loan provider Nellie Mae. Even before graduation, almost a quarter of undergraduates carry a balance of more than $3,000.\n\n\"Credit cards are a wonderful device, but they exist to make money for somebody -- and that's not you,\" says Fred Brock, author of \"Live Well on Less Than You Think: The New York Times Guide to Achieving Your Financial Freedom\" and a journalism professor at Kansas State University. Modern life requires credit, he notes, \"but boy, do you need to be careful. You're playing with fire.\" Using your credit card? Here are 13 tips to raise your game and keep you out of financial jail: 13 tips on using your credit card 1. Before you leave home, talk with your parents. 2. Don't get a card for the promotional prizes. 3. Shop around. 4. Know the rules of your card. 5. Have your own rules for using the card. 6. Protect your credit rating. 7. Read the credit card statement as soon as it comes. 8. Use a card, pay the balance. 9. Forgo cash advances. 10. Know that card companies exchange information. 11. Don't just make minimum payments. 12. Be prepared to stand up for yourself once in a while. 13. Look out for those warning signals of too much debt. 1. Before you leave home, talk with your parents. Chances are, they've had credit cards for years. They'll know a few things about how they work and how quickly those balances can creep up. Work out a budget so you know what you have to live on. What do you do in an emergency? If something happens and you need an airline ticket home, a visit to the dentist or a part for the car, is there a bank account you tap? Or is that when you use a credit card? And if so, who pays the bill? If they do hand you a card \"for emergencies,\" what does that mean to them? 2. Don't get a card for the promotional prizes. \"There are schools that prohibit credit card solicitation on campus,\" says Marjorie Savage, author of \"You're on Your Own (But I'm Here If You Need Me).\" But some campuses allow it and \"there are credit card companies that turn it into a circus,\" using promotional items such as sunglasses to lure students. \"And students fall for it,\" she says. Students think \"I won't use (the card), but I'll get it anyway,\" she says. It's a lot cheaper to put aside a couple of bucks and buy those sunglasses or alarm clock. 3. Shop around. If applying for a credit card is part of your financial plan, use multiple offers to your advantage. You only need one card, so compare: advertisement replacecontent-tcm:8-5455 Shop around: \u2022 What's the annual percentage rate, or APR? You should be offered a decent rate if you've never had problems with credit before. \"Anything more than 2 or 3 points above prime is, in my opinion, outrageous,\" says Brock. \u2022 How long will that APR last? \"If anyone tells you they are giving you a permanent interest rate, walk away,\" says Brock. \"There is no such thing.\" \u2022 What's the penalty fee for a late payment, and what's considered late? Some companies mark you late if it arrives the day it's due but after a certain time of day. \u2022 What's the penalty rate? You could get your rate hiked after just one late payment. So how high could it go? \"I'm one who thinks you should be really leery of deals on credit cards,\" says Brock. \"You don't want frequent flier miles or bonus deals.\" Instead, look for a card with fairly simple rules, a reputation for treating customers well, a low interest rate, and the amount of credit you need."}
{"title": "Accounting Rules for Payable & Receivable", "text": "In their financial statements, many businesses report a substantial portion of their assets as coming from receivable accounts. Beginning investors are sometimes surprised to learn that although a business might be reporting these assets, they haven't actually been realized in cash yet. Payables -- money owed by the business to vendors -- are usually more straightforward. In either case, learning some of the rules that govern accounting for payables and receivables can help ease confusion.In most cases, companies that use receivables and payables account for their business activities using the accrual basis of accounting. The fundamental rule underlying the accrual basis is that revenues from receivables are recognized when they are earned, even if they are not yet paid.Receivables are not recognized on the cash basis of accounting; companies on the cash basis record transactions only when cash actually changes hands. Because of this concept, revenues can be much larger than the company's bank account would suggest, especially if the company relies heavily on receivables for income.Similar to the rule with receivables, reporting on the accrual basis for payables means that the company records debts as expenses even if it has not yet paid them. The company does not record all of its hypothetical expenses, only those that it is specifically obligated to.On the cash basis of accounting, companies do not record payables because they do not represent cash expenditures. Recording debts when they are obligated usually provides a more accurate picture of the company's performance -- businesses can fail if they have too much debt, even if they appear to have substantial cash.Both receivables and payables can be reported as either current or long-term assets and liabilities. Generally, the rule for recording a receivable or a payable as a current asset or liability is whether it is expected to be realized as cash within a year.For example, if the company purchases materials from a vendor on credit, it would be considered a current liability only if the terms required payment in less than one year from the purchase. If the vendor extends credit for longer, only the portion of the payment due within a year is considered current.Accounting rules require businesses to record a transaction whenever it pays its bills to creditors or receives cash from customers. It is important to keep in mind, though, that these transactions are not recorded as either new revenue or expenses. This is because they were recognized when they were agreed to, so the commitment of cash does not change the business's equity. Only the changes to the cash account are recorded when receivables or payables are realized.Because the due dates for receivables and payables do not always line up, the company must keep a careful eye on its cash flow to make sure money is available to meet obligations when they come due."}

{"title": "Reasons for an Insurance Company to Deny a House Fire", "text": "Each year, many homes are destroyed in fires. These fires start from a multitude of reasons: some are accidental (smoking in bed), and some are from fireplaces, space heaters or faulty electrical issues in the home. Each fire is investigated to locate the \"hot spot,\" which is where the fire began. Insurance companies always get a report from the fire department, and have their own investigators come out and survey the damage to determine how much damage was done and the cause of the fire. They need to know all of this in order to begin the process of paying your claim. However, not all claims get paid for several reasons.\n\nFire Emergencies: Safeguard Your Home\n\nIllegal Activity\n\nYour insurance claim can be denied if there is any evidence that a fire was caused by illegal activity, such as drug manufacturing. Insurance policies have many exceptions and loopholes, but this one is obvious. If you are a landlord and own rental property, an inspection of your property from time to time may give you hints as to your tenant's activities. Prohibit these activities in print in your lease agreement and file an eviction notice if you find illegal activities going on.\n\nUnpermitted Work\n\nIf a fire is deemed to be caused by electrical issues in a home where the electrical work was not permitted by the county in which the home is located, the insurance company can deny a claim. For example, if you bought a home with a finished basement, but later found out the previous owner did the work himself, and did not get permits or inspections, this may be a reason for denying a claim if it can be proven that the fire was started as a result of faulty basement wiring.\n\nFraud\n\nInsurance claims for a house fire can be denied by the insurance company if they determine that your claim contains fraudulent information or the list of burned contents seems excessive. (For example: You state you owned six television sets, and the inspector finds evidence of four.) You may have to prove the contents you state that were in the home at the time of the fire. The best way to do this is to videotape the home and its contents, noting key spots where art or other valuables are kept. These items should match the additional riders added to your insurance policy for extra coverage. Standard content insurance will be for a round number for replacement of all items, but special art should be appraised and added separately. Keep the video in a safety deposit box.\n\nInadequate Coverage\n\nNot enough coverage is not a denial of a claim, but it is not enough funds to rebuild a home as it was. Check your policy from year to year to be sure your policy gives you enough money for the replacement cost of the home. This is all about contractor and material costs, and has nothing to do with appraised values of homes. Your appraised value may be lower, but the cost to build always goes up."}
{"title": "7 Ways to Find Extra Money to Pay Off Credit Card Debt", "text": "If you\u2019re knee-deep in credit card debt, it\u2019s easy to get caught in the minimum payment trap. But putting extra cash toward your credit card bill every month is your ticket to saving money on interest and improving your financial flexibility. Here are a few ways to find more money to pay off your credit card debt now and in the future.\nWe\u2019re not suggesting you starve yourself to get out of debt. But instead of heading to the grocery store the next time you\u2019re running low on food, take a second look at your pantry. You may find enough food to make a few decent meals if you\u2019re creative. You can then take whatever money you would have spent on unnecessary groceries and put it toward your debt.\n2. Enlist a trusted friend to cut your hair\nThe average price of a woman\u2019s hair cut in the United States is $44, according to data from mobile payment company Square, while a man\u2019s haircut averages $28 (and that\u2019s not including a tip). Let\u2019s say a woman spends the average $44 for a haircut every six weeks \u2014 or eight times a year \u2014 that\u2019s an average savings of $352. That\u2019s a nice chunk of change to throw at debt! However, because you\u2019re the one that has to live with your decisions, be sure to find a friend who has a steady hand.\n3. Go out for ice cream instead of dinner\nThe thought of telling your friends you can\u2019t go out on the weekends because you\u2019re trying to pay off debt might be terrifying. But on an average night, dinner and drinks could easily cost you $50. So instead of going out for dinner or drinks every weekend, try ice cream or frozen yogurt. You\u2019ll still get to socialize, but you can set aside what you\u2019re saving to add to your credit card bill.\n4. Cut back on giving\nAccording to the National Philanthropic Trust, 95.4% of American households give an average of $2,974 to charity annually. In a 2014 NerdWallet study, the Nerds found that U.S. households that carry debt have more than five times that amount in credit card debt. Even if you cut the average giving in half to pay off debt, that\u2019s almost $1,500 a year.\nRepurposing charitable giving for debt repayment may seem selfish. But as airlines suggest when covering plane safety procedures, you can put yourself in danger if you don\u2019t put on your own oxygen mask before helping your neighbor with theirs. The sooner you pay off your debt, the more flexibility you have to give to charity.\n5. Automate savings specifically to pay off debt\nOne of the most effective ways to save money is to treat your savings like a bill, so why not set up a savings account meant for debt reduction? Most banks allow you to set up a recurring transfer from your checking account to your savings account. Another option is to use an automated savings tool like Digit. Automating your debt payoff amount every month may give you less flexibility to spend your money how you want during the month. But once your credit cards are paid off, you\u2019ll have more flexibility in the long run.\n\u00bb MORE: How to pay off debt\n6. Sell your stuff\nChances are you have stuff lying around the house that you no longer use. Instead of letting it collect dust, try selling it on Craigslist or eBay. Another option is to set up a yard sale. You may not get a lot of money for your things, but every last dollar counts when you\u2019re tackling your debt.\n7. Rent out a room\nIf you have some extra space, considering renting out one of your rooms for a few hundred dollars a month. Because you\u2019ll be sharing common living space, you\u2019ll need to exercise caution with this option. The best choice is to rent to someone you know. You can also list your extra room on vacation rental site Airbnb. The process is simple, and Airbnb offers certain protections for hosts.\nThe bottom line\nInstead of using a debt snowball, try the debt snowflake method: Find little chunks of extra cash in your everyday spending to use to pay off your credit card debt. It may not have a big impact immediately, but small efforts like these can help you save money on interest and pay off your credit card debt sooner.\nBen Luthi is a staff writer covering personal finance for NerdWallet.

{"title": "Are You Wasting Your Time in Meetings?", "text": "People spend so much time in meetings that turning meeting time into sustained results is a priority for successful organizations. Actions that make meetings successful require management before, during, and after the meeting.If you neglect any one of these meeting management opportunities, your meetings will not bear the fruit you desire from the time you invest. Take these twelve meeting management actions to guide attendees to achieve expected, positive, and constructive outcomes.What to Do Before the Meeting to Ensure Effective MeetingsActions before the meeting establish the groundwork for accomplishing meeting results. You can do all of the needed follow-ups but without an effective meeting plan to start, your results will disappoint you.Plan the MeetingEffective meetings that produce results begin with meeting planning. First, identify whether other employees are needed to help you plan the meeting. Then, decide what you hope to accomplish by holding the meeting. Establish doable goals for your meeting.The goals you set will establish the framework for an effective meeting plan. As Stephen Covey says in the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, \"Begin with the end in mind.\" Your meeting purpose will determine the meeting focus, the meeting agenda, and the meeting participants.Make Sure You Need a MeetingOnce you\u2019ve developed your meeting plan, ensure that a meeting is an appropriate vehicle for accomplishing the set goals. To schedule and hold a meeting is expensive when you account for the time of the people attending, so make efforts to determine that a meeting is the best opportunity to solve the problem, improve the process, or make an ongoing plan.You may find that you can accomplish the meeting goals with an email discussion or by distributing and requesting information through the company newsletter. Make sure the meeting is needed and not just convenient for you \u2013 you\u2019ll get better results from attendees.Ensure Appropriate Participation at the MeetingIf a meeting is the appropriate means to accomplish your goals, check with the participants who must attend the meeting to succeed. The needed attendees must be available to attend the meeting.Postpone the meeting rather than holding a meeting without critical staff members. If a delegate attends in the place of a crucial decision maker, make sure the designated staff member has the authority to make decisions \u2013 or postpone the meeting.Distribute and Review Pre-work Prior to the MeetingHow many meetings have you attended that started out with the meeting facilitator passing out a ream of handouts or projecting a Microsoft PowerPoint slide for discussion? Frustrating? You bet. The meeting becomes a group read-in, hardly productive for goal accomplishment.You can make meetings most productive and ensure results by providing necessary pre-work in advance of the actual meeting. Providing pre-work, charts, graphs, and reading material 48 hours before a meeting affects meeting success. The more preparation time you allot, the better-prepared people will be for your meeting.Documentation that will help you achieve the meeting goals can include reports; data and charts such as competitive information, sales month-to-date, and production plans; Microsoft PowerPoint slides that illustrate key discussion points; and minutes, notes and follow-up from earlier or related meetings and projects.Pre-work distributed in a timely manner, with the serious expectation that attendees will read the pre-work before the meeting, helps ensure meeting success.More about running effective meetings:Tips for Meeting Implementation and FacilitationTips for Meeting Follow-upDuring the Meeting to Ensure Effective MeetingsEffective use of meeting time builds enthusiasm for the topic. It generates commitment and a feeling of accomplishment from the participants. People feel part of something bigger than their day-to-day challenges. Therefore, a well-facilitated, active meeting that sets the stage for follow-up will produce meeting results.Effective Meeting FacilitationThe meeting leader sets a positive, productive tone for interaction among the meeting participants. Effective meeting facilitation starts with a review of the goals, or anticipated outcomes, and the agenda. The facilitator helps group members stay focused and productive.Meeting design and the agenda set the framework for the meeting. An effective facilitator, who keeps participants on track, ensures the accomplishment of expected, desired results from the meeting.Use the Pre-work in the MeetingUse or reference the pre-work and other information supplied prior to the meeting during the meeting. You reinforce the need for participants to spend the time needed up front to review material that is integral to accomplishing the desired results.Your participants will prepare prior to attending your meetings and your results will bear testimony to solid preparation and leadership.Involve Each Participant in ActionsEvery work group has various personalities that show up for meetings. You have quiet coworkers and people who try to dominate every platform. Whether facilitating or attending the meeting, you need to involve each attendee in the accomplishment of the meeting goals.This ensures that each participant is invested in the topic of the meeting and in the follow-up. You\u2019ll accomplish more results with the whole team pulling than with one dominant staff person trying to push everyone else up the hill.Create an Effective Meeting Follow-up PlanDuring the meeting, make a follow-up plan with action items. Effective plans include:the specific action item,the name of the person who committed to \u201cowning\u201d the accomplishment of the action item,the due date of the action item,an agreement about what constitutes completion of the action item.Discuss real life scenarios and barriers to success that team members may experience as they try to accomplish the items that will produce the required results. Set a time for your next meeting, if needed, while participants are in attendance.More about running effective meetings:Tips for Meeting PlanningTips for Meeting Follow-upAfter the Meeting to Ensure Effective MeetingsActions and planning before and during the meeting play a big role in helping you achieve expected, positive, and constructive outcomes. Your actions following the meeting are just as crucial. Follow-up at the next scheduled meeting is never enough of an investment to ensure results.Publish Meeting MinutesBegin by publishing your minutes and action plan within 24 hours. People will most effectively contribute to results if they get started on action items right away. They still have a fresh memory of the meeting, the discussion and the rationale for the chosen direction.They remain enthusiastic and ready to get started. A delay in the distribution of minutes will hurt your results since most people wait for the minutes to arrive before they begin to tackle their commitments.Effective Meeting Follow-upRespecting and observing deadlines and follow-up will help you achieve results from your meetings. The deadline was established during the meeting. Following the meeting, each person with an action item should also make a plan for their personal accomplishment of their commitment.Whether they write the steps in their planner, delegate the tasks to another staff person, or just complete the task, the individual is responsible for follow-up.So is the meeting planner. You can improve meeting results by following up with each person who has an action item mid-way between meetings. Your goal is to check progress and ensure that tasks are underway. Remember that what you ask about gets accomplished.Accountability for Follow-up during the Next MeetingHave you ever sat in a follow-up meeting that consisted of each participant telling the group why they were unable to accomplish their commitment? I have, and the result is deplorable. Establishing the norm or custom of accountability for results begins early in your meeting cycle.Follow-up by the facilitator mid-way between meetings helps, but the group must make failure to keep commitments unacceptable. Report on progress and outcomes at the next meeting and expect that all will have been accomplished. Alternatively, check progress at the next meeting and if there is a real roadblock to progress, determine how to proceed.Debrief the Meeting Process for Continuous ImprovementThe practice of debriefing each meeting is a powerful tool for continuous improvement. Participants take turns discussing what was effective or ineffective about the current meeting process. They also discuss the progress they feel the group is making on the topic of the meeting.Taking continuous improvement to another level, successful teams debrief their entire project as well as the process to determine how effectively they managed to create results. Future meetings reflect the evaluation. Meetings evolve as an even more effective tool for creating organization results.ConclusionResults are achievable and predictable from well-planned and implemented meetings. Follow these twelve recommendations to ensure that meeting attendees achieve expected, positive, and constructive outcomes from the time invested in meetings.More about running effective meetings:Tips for Meeting PlanningTips for Meeting Implementation and Facilitation"}

{"title": "Limited Time Offer: Get Up To 62,500 HHonors Points With the Hilton Honors Credit Card", "text": "Aw, Nerds! Looks like this page might be out of date. Check out our roundup of the Best Hotel Credit Cards.\nThe most common offer on the web for the Hilton Honors\u2122 Surpass\u00ae Card from American Express is for 20,000 bonus points, which isn\u2019t that impressive when you consider that HHonors points are typically only worth 0.5 cents apiece. That low point value actually puts Hilton points behind most other hotel chains in our hotel rewards analysis, and also led us to a pretty lackluster review of the Hilton HHonors program.\nHowever, savvy credit card nerds are never satisfied with the generic deals that everyone else is advertising.

{"title": "How to Trade the VIX", "text": "The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, called the VIX, is a measure of implied volatility of options on stocks in the S&P 500 index. Also referred to as the fear index, it tracks market expectations of stock prices over rolling 30-day periods. Investors become increasingly nervous as volatility increases and display greater concern about market prospects as more options show heightened volatility. This behavior affects stock prices and presents an additional opportunity for profit for investment traders. The CBOE introduced the VIX in 1993.Investors can use market volatility, as indicated by the VIX, to determine opportune moments to trade. They can also use the VIX to take a position on market volatility and create a more diverse portfolio. However, it is not possible to trade the VIX directly. Individuals wishing to benefit from market volatility can trade VIX futures and VIX options, the derivatives of the VIX.On March 26, 2004, the CBOE introduced VIX futures (VX) as the first means of trading market volatility. These are similar to a standard futures contract and are based on a forward 30-day implied volatility of the S&P index. VIX futures allow investors to trade volatility without concern for stock prices. These futures also are an ideal tool for diversify portfolios, speculating and hedging returns on equity.The price of VIX futures is sometimes on par with the VIX. At those times, a low VIX results in a low VIX futures price, while a high VIX results in a premium price. However, this is not always the case, so investors watch for variance and react accordingly.VIX options (VIX) were first available for volatility trading on February 24, 2006. Similar to VIX futures, investors can trade VIX options without concern for market factors that affect stock prices, interest rates and time to expiration. VIX options have call options and put options. The call options allow investors to buy at a fixed price, while the put options allow the holder to sell at a fixed price. Both options must be completed within a given period of time.The VIX moves in an opposite direction from the S&P index. Traders can avoid losses and make gains by carefully watching this movement. For instance, individuals who purchase VIX put options as insurance when market volatility drops can guard against the subsequent drop in stock price. Conversely, traders who purchase VIX call options when market volatility rises can reap the benefits of an increase in stock prices.Individuals can purchase options or futures through investment service websites or through a professional broker. Investors can purchase VIX options with an account approved for options trade. There are no position or exercise limits, according to the CBOE.VIX futures and options expire one Wednesday every month, 30 days before the third Friday of the following month. Investors can trade options up to the Tuesday before they expire and must exercise them on the expiration day. VIX options settle in cash on the day after expiration. The investor\u2019s account shows a deposit or debit based on the results of the trade. The amount debited or credited is the difference between the purchase price and the settlement price multiplied by $100 for VIX options or $1,000 for VIX futures."}
{"title": "What Is a Notice of Probate?", "text": "The executor of an estate has a great deal of responsibility when it comes to probating a deceased individual's estate. One of the responsibilities of the executor is to create and send out a notice of probate. This is a process that notifies others that the estate is in probate.\n\nPublishing Notice of Probate\n\nWhen an individual passes away and an executor is in charge of going through the probate process, some states require a notice of probate to be published in the newspaper. The executor will publish the notice in the newspaper so that potential creditors of the deceased can file claims with the probate court. Part of the probate process involves paying any creditors of the estate, and the creditors may not know to do so unless they see a probate notice in the paper.\n\nNotice for Beneficiaries\n\nAs the executor of estate, it is also your responsibility to send a notice in probate to the beneficiaries of the estate. When an individual creates a will, he specifies exactly who he wants to receive his property. These individuals must be notified in writing by the executor of the estate. The executor includes information such as his address and phone number so that the beneficiaries will know whom to contact. States often have time limits in which this task must be accomplished.\n\nFiling Proof\n\nOnce you send out the notices of probate, you should file proof that you did so with the local court system. The probate court will have a form that you can fill out that shows you sent out the notices in a timely manner. This way, if one of the beneficiaries says that she did not receive notice, you can prove that you sent it out within the time limit set forth by the probate court.\n\nShorten Statute of Limitations\n\nIn some states, you are not required to file a notice of probate in the newspaper for creditors. However, it can sometimes be to your advantage, by shortening the statute of limitations on the debt. For example, the statute of limitations may be shortened from one or two years down to only a few months. This can speed up the probate process and help you get finished much sooner. If creditors do not file a claim within this statute of limitations, they cannot collect any money from the estate."}

For an iPhone perhaps it is a special case, the same for a tablet, but can you customize a camera, such as the Nikon D3200?

For example, you can reassign your buttons to do different things depending on how you want to use your camera.

You can change the brightness on your display monitor; select from two styles of viewing on your screen, classic and graphic; you can add an option to add text to your photos; and allow your camera to automatically record your camera\u2019s orientation, horizontal or vertical.\nWhen it comes to your photos, you can customize options to add a date to all or some of your photos and you can also create custom image storage folders.\nGive it a Special Home\nAside from customizing your modes and settings, you will want to personalize the way you tote around your camera by purchasing a case that says you all over it. There are a wide variety cases on the market to suit your needs.

{"title": "16 Car Noises You Should Not Ignore", "text": "Noises are just part of operating a vehicle.\nTire treads hum against the asphalt, wind whistles as it passes around outboard mirrors, plastic bits and pieces in the dashboard generate little squeaks as they rub together and so forth.\nMost of us don't even notice these harmless notes after a while. But some noises aren't so innocuous. You should not ignore certain thumping, banging, clicking and squealing sounds. These sounds often rear their heads or intensify whenever the driver takes specific actions such as stepping on the accelerator, depressing the brake pedal or turning the steering wheel sharply.\nListen for these noises. If any suddenly becomes part of your everyday driving experience, it's time to take action. Something is probably very wrong. Ignoring the symptom won't make the problem magically go away. Delay can provide the time for a problem to worsen, and that usually translates into a bigger and more expensive repair.\nHere are some of the more common noises that can spell trouble and their possible causes:\nCommon car noises Any sound when turning a corner. Clunking when braking. Flapping. Grinding manual transmission when shifting. Hissing or sizzling under the hood. Knocking from the engine compartment. Loud bang. Low-pitch humming under the car. Popping from the engine compartment. Rattles from beneath the vehicle. Roaring that increases with acceleration. Squealing or chirping on acceleration. Squealing wheels when applying brakes. Scraping or grinding when applying brakes. Tapping or clicking from the engine compartment. Whining.\nAny sound when turning a corner: More than likely this is related to the steering linkage. It either needs lubricating, or is damaged and requires replacement.\nClunking when braking: A brake caliper or other hardware is damaged, missing or improperly mounted.\nFlapping: This could either be something interfering with the fan or a belt disintegrating.\nGrinding manual transmission when shifting: This is probably a clutch issue. It is either worn or requires adjusting. It could also indicate a deeper problem within the transmission.\nHissing or sizzling under the hood: Heard when the engine is first shut off, something is leaking. Coolant or oil could be leaking onto a heated engine part, such as the exhaust manifold; a vacuum line could be leaking; or the engine could be overheating.\nKnocking in engine compartment: It's a myth that there are benefits from using a higher-octane gasoline in your vehicle than the owner's manual specifies; however, using a lower-grade fuel can very well produce engine knock. Follow the owner's manual requirements in all things oil, gasoline and tire air pressure.\nLoud bang: If the sound is as if someone put a cherry bomb in your tailpipe, it's a backfire. It could be the air-fuel mixture is too rich. It could also indicate that the catalytic converter isn't functioning properly.\nLow-pitch humming or whirring under car: This could have any number of causes. If it changes with acceleration, the differential may need lubricant, the transmission may be failing, the universal joints may be worn or a wheel bearing could be shot. The problem is, the sounds under a vehicle tend to reverberate and echo to the point that it's impossible for a lay person to determine the source."}

{"title": "How to Get Retail Businesses on Board With Newspaper Advertising", "text": "If you want to know how to sell newspaper advertising to retail businesses, you should start by looking at what may appear to be its drawbacks. Critics may say newspaper advertising doesn't have the interaction of online media, the sizzle of television commercials or the low cost of radio ads. Still, for many businesses, newspaper advertising is the most effective way of finding customers. If you work for a newspaper, make sure you know how to sell the advantages of newspaper advertising so you don't lose business to your on-air or online competitors.Newspaper Advertisements Offer a Complete Sales PitchCheck out a car dealership's TV commercial. In 30 seconds, there's only time to gloss over the details of a closeout sale and have enough time to tell viewers where to find the car lot. On the radio, you can't even see the cars.That's why newspaper advertising can boost floor traffic for any business. A full-page ad can show off all the cars, with prices and finance rates, and include a map to the dealership. A reader can study the ad without having the typical TV commercial announcer yelling at her to buy now before it's too late.You can sell the client on choosing the correct type of newspaper ad to meet his needs and his budget. If that same client goes to a TV or radio station, his only choices are likely a :10, :15 or :30 spot. With newspaper advertising, they can study the rate card to choose to advertise just his logo, address, and phone number, or a full-color ad that can highlight his entire inventory. For businesses new to advertising, buying a print ad is a more low-key decision than trying to decide how to produce a complicated, expensive TV commercial. Use that advantage to calm nerves and get the deal signed.Newspaper Advertisements Are Ideal for CouponsThe couponing craze makes a compelling argument for you to sell newspaper advertising to a reluctant business owner. Many businesses yearn for an increase in floor traffic. Putting a coupon into a print ad is an ideal way for them to get more people through their doors.TV or radio commercials may say, \"Mention this ad for 5% off\", but that's likely not the sure-fire traffic booster as having a printed coupon that gets into the customer's hand. Plus, a business has an easier time managing expiration dates with a print ad than in the fine print that flies by in a TV commercial.A possible side benefit to your newspaper is that a great coupon promotion might actually boost newsstand sales. A great offer of $20 off a pair of jeans might have some people buying two, five or more papers just to get the coupons.Newspaper Advertisements Appear Before a Captive AudienceThe biggest obstacle to any form of advertising is having the audience tune out the message. With radio, a listener may switch stations when the commercials come on. With television, a commercial break becomes a potty break.But even a casual newspaper reader will flip the pages and scan them. Provided that you can create eye-catching newspaper advertisements, you can get your client noticed.True, there are some places in a newspaper that are more desirable than others. But a client can definitely get noticed through a newspaper insert. When a reader pulls out the inserts from the middle of the newspaper, her hands will be on the ad and she can't help but glance at it, especially if it is in color.Newspaper advertisements may not be as flashy as their counterparts online or on radio or television, but for clients interested in a cost-effective, no-frills approach to boosting their sales, even black-and-white images can put green into their cash registers. It's your job to convince them."}
{"title": "Get Your College Freshman Ready to Leave the Roost", "text": "So, your \u201clittle baby\u201d is getting ready to fly the coop in a month or so. Is everyone ready for the big transition? If not, there are a few things you can do now to make it a little easier on everyone. Of course you want to think about supplies - put together a list and then go shopping when you see items on sale. Make sure your student has a good computer that will get him or her through four years of use. Consider what clothing needs to go now and what can be moved when your student comes home for breaks. Then take the following steps to keep making progress towards that college goal: Pay Your Tuition on Time: This may seem obvious but some students and parents seem to get caught by surprise when it comes time to pay the tuition. Check on your school\u2019s website or look for emails from the college that will tell you when tuition is due. Then be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to research and apply for any federal or private student loans before you need to make payment. Don\u2019t Overload on Student Loans: Only borrow the amount that is needed to cover the tuition and college expenses. Student loans should not be used for living expenses - these should be paid for from earnings or savings whenever possible. Use federal student loans first, and then look for private student loan options. Never borrow more than you need for expenses, as interest may start accruing, depending on the type of loan. Attend Orientation: It is a helpful idea for your student to attend orientation, if possible. This is a good chance for students to get familiar with the campus, meet classmates, learn about the registration process, and experience a little independence. Look for Book Options: If your child is able to register for classes, try to determine what textbooks will be required. Research online and digital textbook options to find the best deals. Discuss Money Expectations: Now is the time to discuss money expectations, not after your student graduates. Students should be aware of how much spending money they have available, what their credit limits are, and who is going to be responsible for paying off those student loans upon graduation. It can be dangerous when parents and students each assume the other will be paying for the student loans. Set a Budget: This is the best time for your student to learn how to budget money. Spend some time calculating how much money is available through savings, earnings, and money from the parents. Then look carefully at the monthly expenses, and help your child set a realistic spending budget for each month. Set Some Limits: Although technology makes it easier for parents to communicate with students who are away at college, it is not always the best idea to be in constant contact with each other. Set some communication limits, so your child can learn to make decisions.Most importantly, don\u2019t forget to create fun memories. This may be the last real summer you have together as a family. The older child may be interested in jobs, internships, or study abroad opportunities, while younger children may start the college process themselves. Set a special day or week where you just spend some time together without the pressure of paying for college, and really get to know this new person who is now a college freshman."}
{"title": "Money Market Account Definition", "text": "What is a money market account?\nA money market account is a type of interest-bearing account than offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.\nTo accommodate for this higher interest rate, most money market accounts have minimum balance requirements. Many money market accounts are seen as a blend between traditional checking and savings accounts, offering the account holder regular access to funds along with limited check-writing ability.\nKeep in mind that money market accounts are not the same as money market funds, which are investment accounts.\nHistory of the money market account\nLooking for a way that credit unions and banks could compete with the money market fund investment accounts, the U.S. government created money market accounts. This was necessary because financial institutions were not allowed to pay interest on checking accounts.\nSavvy customers who wanted both an investment return and access to their funds abandoned their checking accounts for the allure of the money market funds.\nTo win these customers back, the government created money market accounts. By classifying these new accounts as savings accounts, banks and credit unions could pay interest on deposits while still giving customers transaction access.\nMoney market account restrictions\nBecause they have minimum balance requirements, money market accounts aren't for everyone. These requirements can vary from bank to bank, with some institutions requiring a minimum account as low as $100 and others mandating initial deposits as high as $10,000.\nMany money market accounts come with added features like debit cards and personal checks, but there are limits to their use.\nBecause the money market account is a type of glorified savings account, it is ruled by the Federal Reserve's Regulation D, which limits the amount of times you can make an online transfer or withdraw money using a check or debit card to six transactions per month. If you want regular access to your money, it may be wiser to choose a checking account.\nWhy choose a money market account?\nA money market account can be a good option if you have a large amount of money that you want to save, but aren't willing to invest. Savings designated for household emergencies or a down payment on a home might fall into this category. You may consider choosing a money market account for these reasons:\nYou don't want to risk the volatility of the stock market.\nYou have a large amount of cash to place in savings.\nYou want a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.\nYou want the ability to write checks from time to time.\nYou want quick access to your money.\nIf any of the above doesn't apply to you, you may want to consider other options like a traditional checking or savings account, a certificate of deposit (CD) or even investing in stocks or mutual funds.\nHowever, for certain circumstances, the money market account may be the best place to securely keep your money so that it can earn a bit of interest.\nThings to look for in a money market account\nAlmost all banks and credit unions offer money market accounts, so it's best to compare several different financial institutions before opening an account. Be sure to include online financial institutions in your research, as they often offer some of the best interest rates. Here are some features to consider:\nInterest rates.\nMinimum balance policies.\nApplicable fees.\nAny restrictions on the access to your funds.\nKeep in mind that as long as you choose a financial institution backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), your money is insured up to $250,000."}
{"title": "How to File a Lien on Property When Owed Money", "text": "Collecting on a judgment by placing a lien against the debtor's property can be a slow process, but you'll usually end up collecting more than the amount of the original debt for your patience. Technically, the lien itself doesn't mean the person who owes you money must pay you. But if he wants to sell his property or refinance it, the lien usually bars him from doing so unless he settles his debt to you.\n\nStep\n\nFile a collection lawsuit against the debtor. Depending on how much he owes you, you can file a complaint for collection in your state's small claims court or civil court. Small claims courts are usually limited to debts of less than $10,000, and in some states it is even less.\n\nStep\n\nServe the debtor with a copy of your complaint after you've filed it with the court. In some states, this means giving the copy to the county sheriff and having him deliver it to the debtor personally. Other states allow you to send it to him by certified mail, return receipt requested, or the court will forward a copy to the debtor for you. When you file your lawsuit, ask the court clerk to explain your state's procedure.\n\nStep\n\nAttend the court hearing. The court will send you a notice letting you known when it is scheduled. If the debtor doesn't respond to your lawsuit, the judge will order a default judgment against her. Otherwise, if she answers and appears, you will have to argue your case and prove to the judge that she owes you the money.\n\nStep\n\nTake a certified copy of your judgment to the recorder's office if your lawsuit is successful. Go to the recorder's office in the county where your debtor's property is located. A certified copy is the original one the court gives you, usually embossed or marked with an official seal.\n\nStep\n\nAsk the recorder's office for any additional forms you might need to file in addition to your judgment. The exact procedure varies from state to state. Illinois requires you to file a memorandum of judgment and California requires an abstract of judgment form. Complete the appropriate forms and file them with the county recorder. The clerk will make and keep a copy of your judgment and officially place your lien against the debtor's property."}

For some jobs, it may be necessary to hold multiple certifications, by passing multiple exams. For most FINRA certifications, re-testing every few years is necessary, to demonstrate that you have kept up with developments in the industry.Taking FINRA TestsYou cannot take FINRA tests as an individual. Instead, you must be sponsored by a FINRA member firm. Thus, your employer will determine what tests you need to pass, depending on your job. Training for FINRA tests normally is through self-study, although some employers may offer in-house prep classes.Per the above, attempting to change employers and move into a new job for which you do not already have the necessary FINRA certification can be problematic. Your new firm would, in effect, be hiring you on a contingent basis. You, meanwhile, will be in a potentially difficult spot if you do not pass the test.Series 7: The Series 7 General Securities Representative qualification is perhaps the best known, mandatory for Financial Advisors and certain other sales positions.Series 6: The Series 6 qualification allows the holder to transact business in a much more limited set of investment products than Series 7. These are essentially limited to packaged investment products such as mutual funds and variable annuities.Series 63 and 66: The Series 63 and Series 66 exams cover state securities regulations, and also may be necessary for most Financial Advisor positions.Series 65: Series 65 is the Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam which qualifies the holder to be an investment advisor representative.NASAANote that, while the Series 63, 65 and 66 exams are administered by FINRA, they are prepared by a separate organization, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). Also, unlike most FINRA tests, you do not need to be sponsored by a FINRA member firm to take the Series 63, 65 or 66. Many states accept various other qualifications, most notably the CFP or the CFA, in lieu of passing the Series 65 or 66 exams.For more information: See the FINRA website.Job Openings: See this list of current job openings at FINRA."}

{"title": "What Weak Commodities Mean for Emerging Markets", "text": "Commodity prices have moved sharply lower throughout 2015 and 2016 amid China\u2019s economic slowdown and the rising U.S. dollar valuation. With the rising production of crude oil and agricultural commodities, prices are expected to remain weak for the foreseeable future as the global economy struggles to regain traction. Investors have an interest in these trends on both the commodity level and in terms of countries that have exposure to the commodities.In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at what weak commodity prices mean for many emerging market economies that are dependent upon them.Determine Commodity ExposureEmerging markets tend to be grouped into the same basket by international investors, but their exposure to commodities ranges considerably. Countries like Brazil have substantial commodities exposure that ranges from crude oil obtained through its quazi-governmental Petrobras to iron-ore produced by billion-dollar publicly-traded companies like Vale SA. But other countries, like India are better-known for their technological prowess than commodities.International investors should carefully examine their emerging market holdings when determining how much exposure they have to commodities. The easiest way to analyze exposure is to look at the holdings of country exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) to see how much allocation is given to Basic Materials relative to other industries. Often times, this data can be easily found in a fund\u2019s prospectus or website or through third-party websites like ETFdb.com or ETF.com. Analyzing Commodity PerformanceAll commodities shouldn\u2019t be treated the same, since each has a different supply and demand dynamic at various points in time. For example, canola and ethanol were both strong performers between mid-2014 and mid-2015, despite the widespread decline in many other commodities like crude oil and precious metals. There are also performance differences between classes of commodities, such as energy, agriculture, or metals, depending on various macroeconomic factors.International investors should carefully consider their exposure to specific commodities, as well as commodities in general. While these dynamics can be more difficult to determine, the equity component of many country ETFs provide a hint as to specific commodity exposure. An investor might look at the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) and see that Petrobras accounts for about 3.47% of the total allocation, which means that crude oil exposure is relatively high.Hedging Commodity ExposureInternational investors looking to address commodity exposure within the emerging market component of their portfolios have many options. The first option is to simply sell exposure to commodity-focused emerging market equities in order to reduce their exposure. While this may effectively reduce future exposure, the sale of stock may generate capital gains taxes and come at an inopportune time.Investors that aren\u2019t looking to sell their positions may instead want to consider buying stock options to hedge their exposure. By purchasing put options, investors can establish a floor for their position and offset any future losses without actually having to sell the equity position. The benefit is that no capital gains taxes are incurred and there\u2019s little risk of missing an unexpected recovery in commodity prices, although a slight premium is paid.In general, most financial advisors recommend only modest exposure to direct commodities and diversification across both emerging and developed markets. Investors that remain diversified face less risk associated with a decline in any single commodity or commodity-dependent country and tend to realize higher risk-adjusted returns over time.Key Takeaway PointsCommodity prices have a big impact on certain emerging markets, which could in turn have an impact on international investors\u2019 portfolios.Investors should begin by assessing their exposure to emerging markets and then determine which commodities have the greatest impact.There are many different ways to hedge against declines, including outright sales or purchasing put options to offset losses.Investors should carefully consider all of their option before making a decision in order to enhance their long-term risk-adjusted returns."}

{"title": "The Best Way to Freeze Blueberries", "text": "Blueberries are only in season for a few weeks. So if you want to have fresh-tasting blueberries all year, but you don't want to pay outrageous supermarket prices for imported berries, you'll need to take action when they're ripe in your area. That means freezing your own blueberries for use later.Frozen (and then defrosted) blueberries aren't as good as fresh (freezing changes the texture and sometimes the taste a bit), but they work fine in pancakes and muffins, in smoothies, or as a topping for your oatmeal.If you grow your own blueberries (which is surprisingly easy and yields more every year), you'll want to freeze some of them for later use. But even if you buy your blueberries, you still can freeze them. Just purchase them when they're in season and cheap (maybe work a deal with a local farmer), eat what you want, and preserve the rest.How to Freeze Blueberries SuccessfullyTo do this, you'll want the freshest possible blueberries. In addition, some people say that smaller blueberries freeze better than larger ones, but if your crop is mainly large berries, don't worry to much about that.Here are the steps you'll need to take: Wash your blueberries in a colandar and pat them completely dry. Make certain there's no water remaining when you place them in the freezer.Sort out any under-ripe, over-ripe, bruised or otherwise damaged berries. Also remove any leaves, stems or debris.Pour the blueberries onto a cookie sheet in a single layer. This will keep them from freezing together in clumps.Clear out a flat space in your freezer for your cookie sheet.Place the tray in the coldest part of your freezer, and leave it there until the berries are completely frozen.Transfer the frozen blueberries to a freezer bag or another freezer-safe container of your choice. Do this quickly to make sure they don't start to defrost. Strong zipper-lock plastic bags work fine.Place your blueberries in a freezer spot that protects them from being crushed by heavier frozen foods. Your frozen blueberries should keep in the freezer indefinitely, but they are best used within six months of freezing, especially if you don't have a particularly cold freezer.More Tips on Freezing BlueberriesIf you're preserving a lot of food, it's easy to get confused about what's in your freezer. Stay on top of this by labeling all bags and containers with their contents and the date that you froze them. Then, tack a freezer inventory list on the door, so you can see what you have at a glance."}
{"title": "Understanding What is a CM at Risk, Role and Responsibilities.", "text": "Construction management at Risk, or CM at Risk, is an innovative approach  to construction project delivery. CM at risk presents a cost-effective alternative to the traditional design-bid-build process. The CM at risk will save your money by reducing the time in your construction project. The CM at risk can be a general construction contractor with technical and financial capabilities appropriate to the project.Role of the CM at RiskThe CM at risk is a delivery approach on which the construction management firm act as an owner's consultant during the pre-development phase of the project. During this process, the owner of the project will rely on the CM at Risk, so it will be empowered to contract multiple subcontractors and will be acknowledged as the sole point of responsibility for the project delivery. During this process, the CM at risk will possess the risk of hiring the subcontractors that will eventually be developing the project. A CM at risk will normally try to establish a GMP or guaranteed maximum price from subcontractors once the project has been designed.The final construction price is the sum of the CM\u2019s at Risk fee, the subcontractors\u2019 bids, and allowances. The owner will not pay more than the GMP, and retains a portion of savings.CM at Risk ServicesThe CM at risk is responsible for managing all subcontracts during the predevelopment stage and the owner might also want to transfer additional responsibilities to the CM at risk. The CM at risk firm might also be responsible for assisting the owner in the following areas:Construction ScheduleProject BudgetCash Flow AnalysisDiscussion and acceptance of Means and MethodsValue EngineeringCost ProjectsDuring the early stages of the project, the focus of the CM at risk will be on the cost control and schedule coordination, but once the project kicks off, its role will turn into design and constructibility issues. The CM at risk might always try to offer the owner the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) alternative.Benefits of CM at RiskThe CM at risk would offer the owner the following benefits:Project risk is passed to the CM, reducing the potential owner's risksManage and find alternative and balanced construction schedules Full pre-construction services availableValue engineering and cost analysis with the alternative of the GMP.The engineer of record can be designed as the CM at risk firmReduce the construction time and will be the liaison between the A/E and the construction manager.Offer another professional and expert that will be focused on the construction progressIncrease level of participation between the A/E, contractor and the ownerIncreased cost control as the construction budget will be discussed as an open book relationships with the owner.Prepare bid packagesPrepare conceptual and detailed estimatesUtilize Building Information Modeling (BIM) to ensure constructability of the design while minimizing cost and scheduleAssist the Owner in closing out the various contracts and provide records for retentionCM at Risk DisadvantagesThe CM at risk will also present some issues that might be worthwhile to discuss. The most important disadvantages are:Design team may not take input from CM during designPerception that price competition is limitedIt might not work perfectly on smaller projectsDuring the early stages of the project and before the GMP has been established, there is sometimes ambiguity concerning the scope of work included under the GMP.The owner may be financially liable for exclusions and inconsistencies in the contract documents."}
{"title": "History of the 21-Gun Military Salute", "text": "The practice of firing gun salutes has existed for centuries. Early warriors demonstrated their peaceful intentions by placing their weapons in a position that rendered them ineffective. Apparently, this custom was universal, with the specific act varying with time and place, depending on the weapons being used. A North African tribe, for example, trailed the points of their spears on the ground to indicate that they did not mean to be hostile. In early times, it was customary for a ship entering a friendly port to discharge its cannon to demonstrate that they were unloaded.A Long-Standing TraditionThe tradition of rendering a salute by cannon originated in the 14th century as firearms and cannons came into use. Since these early devices contained only one projectile, discharging them once rendered them ineffective. Originally warships fired seven-gun salutes -- the number seven probably selected because of its astrological and Biblical significance. Seven planets had been identified and the phases of the moon changed every seven days. The Bible states that God rested on the seventh day after Creation, that every seventh year was sabbatical and that the seven times seventh year ushered in the Jubilee year.Land batteries, having a greater supply of gunpowder, were able to fire three guns for every shot fired afloat, hence the salute by shore batteries was 21 guns. The multiple of three probably was chosen because of the mystical significance of the number three in many ancient civilizations. Early gunpowder, composed mainly of sodium nitrate, spoiled easily at sea but could be kept cooler and drier in land magazines. When potassium nitrate improved the quality of gunpowder, ships at sea adopted the salute of 21 guns.For many years, the number of guns fired for various purposes differed from country to country. By 1730, the Royal Navy was prescribing 21 guns for certain anniversary dates, although this was not mandatory as a salute to the Royal family until later in the eighteenth century.Several famous incidents involving gun salutes took place during the American Revolution. On 16 November 1776, the Continental Navy brigantine Andrew Doria, Captain Isaiah Robinson, fired a salute of 13 guns on entering the harbor of St. Eustatius in the West Indies (some accounts give 11 as the number). A few minutes later, the salute was returned by 9 (or 11) guns by order of the Dutch governor of the island. At the time, a 13 gun salute would have represented the 13 newly-formed United States; the customary salute rendered to a republic at that time was 9 guns. This has been called the \"first salute\" to the American flag. About three weeks before, however, an American schooner had had her colors saluted at the Danish island of St. Croix. The flag flown by the Andrew Doria and the unnamed American schooner in 1776 was not the Stars and Stripes, which had not yet been adopted. Rather, it was the Grand Union flag, consisting of thirteen alternating red and white stripes with the British Jack in the union.The first official salute by a foreign nation to the Stars and Stripes took place on 14 February 1778, when the Continental Navy ship Ranger, Captain John Paul Jones, fired 13 guns and received 9 in return from the French fleet anchored in Quiberon Bay, France.The 21-gun salute became the highest honor a nation rendered. Varying customs among the maritime powers led to confusion in saluting and return of salutes. Great Britain, the world's preeminent sea power in the 18th and 19th centuries, compelled weaker nations to salute first, and for a time monarchies received more guns than did republics. Eventually, by agreement, the international salute was established at 21 guns, although the United States did not agree on this procedure until August 1875.Gun Salute System ChangesThe gun salute system of the United States has changed considerably over the years. In 1810, the \"national salute\" was defined by the War Department as equal to the number of states in the Union--at that time 17. This salute was fired by all U.S. military installations at 1:00 p.m. (later at noon) on Independence Day. The President also received a salute equal to the number of states whenever he visited a military installation.The U.S. Navy regulations for 1818 were the first to prescribe a specific manner for rendering gun salutes (although gun salutes were in use before the regulations were written down). Those regulations required that \"When the President shall visit a ship of the United States' Navy, he is to be saluted with 21 guns.\" It may be noted that 21 was the number of states in the Union at that time. For a time thereafter, it became customary to offer a salute of one gun for each state in the Union, although in practice there was a great deal of variation in the number of guns actually used in a salute.'When Gun Salutes are Traditionally UsedIn addition to salutes offered to the President and heads of state, it was also a tradition in the U.S. Navy to render a \"national salute\" on February 22nd (Washington's Birthday) and July 4th (the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence).A twenty-one gun salute for the President and heads of state, Washington's Birthday, and the Fourth of July became the standard in the United States Navy with the issuance of new regulations on 24 May 1842. Those regulations laid out the specifics: \"When the President of the United States shall visit a vessel of the navy, he shall be received with the following honors: The yards shall be manned, all the officers shall be on deck in full uniform, the full guard shall be paraded and present arms, the music shall play a march, and a salute of twenty-one guns shall be fired. He shall receive the same honors when he leaves the ship.\"\"Upon the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the United States, the colors shall be hoisted at sunrise, and all the vessels of the navy shall, when in port, be dressed, and so continue until the colors are hauled down at sunset, if the state of the weather and other circumstances will allow it. At sunrise, at meridian, and at sunset, a salute of twenty-one guns shall be fired from every vessel in commission mounting six guns and upwards.\"\"On the twenty-second day of February, the anniversary of the birth of Washington, a salute of twenty-one guns shall be fired at meridian from every vessel of the navy in commission mounting six guns and upwards.\"Today, the national salute of 21 guns is fired in honor of a national flag, the sovereign or chief of state of a foreign nation, a member of a reigning royal family, and the President, ex-President, and President-elect of the United States. It is also fired at noon of the day of the funeral of a President, ex-President, or President-elect, on Washington's Birthday, Presidents Day, and the Fourth of July. On Memorial Day, a salute of 21-minute guns is fired at noon while the flag is flown at half-mast. Fifty guns are also fired on all military installations equipped to do so at the close of the day of the funeral of a President, ex-President, or President-elect.Gun salutes are also rendered to other military and civilian leaders of this and other nations. The number of guns is based on their protocol rank. These salutes are always in odd numbers. For example, the Vice President of the United States, Secretary Defense, and Secretaries of the Army, Air Force, and Navy all rate 19 guns. The highest-ranking generals in the services (Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of Naval Operations, and the Army and Air Force Chief of Staffs) all rate 17 guns. Other 4-star generals and admirals rate 17 guns. Three-stars rate 15, two-stars rate 13, and one-stars rate 11.Gun Salutes at Military FuneralsAt military funerals, one often sees three volleys of shots fired in honor of the deceased veteran. This is often mistaken by the laymen as a 21-gun salute, although it is entirely different (in the military, a \"gun\" is a large-caliber weapon. The three volleys are fired from \"rifles,\" not \"guns.\" Therefore, the three volleys aren't any kind of \"gun salute,\" at all).Anyone who is entitled to a military funeral (generally anyone who dies on active duty, honorably discharged veterans, and military retirees) are to the three rifle volleys, subject to availability of honor guard teams. As I said, this is not a 21-gun salute, nor any other type of \"gun salute.\" They are simply three rifle volleys fired. The firing team can consist of any number, but one usually sees a team of eight, with a noncommissioned officer in charge of the firing detail. Whether the team consists of three or eight, or ten, each member fires three times (three volleys).The three volleys come from an old battlefield custom. The two warring sides would cease hostilities to clear their dead from the battlefield, and the firing of three volleys meant that the dead had been properly cared for and the side was ready to resume the battle.The flag detail often slips three shell casings into the folded flag before presenting the flag to the family. Each casing represents one volley.More About Military Traditions and HistoryMarine Corps Customs and TraditionsWhat Are Military Challenge Coins?History of Taps in the MilitaryU.S. Military Beret HistoryMilitary Rank and Insignia ChartOrigins of \"Hooah\"Much of the above information compiled from the Naval Historical Society and the Army Center of Military History."}
{"title": "How to Get My Money Back From an Auto Mechanic Who Charged for Services That Didn't Fix My Car", "text": "When your four-wheeled baby suddenly starts buckling and coughing out black smoke, you take it to your mechanic to get it fixed. Like a doctor, the mechanic will typically diagnose the problem first, tell you what needs to be repaired or replaced, and tell you how much it'll cost you to get your car back into shape. When an approved repair does not fix the problem, the mechanic failed to correctly diagnose the problem in the first place. When this happens, mechanics will often refuse to provide you a refund, since they did spend time working on your car and paid out-of-pocket for any parts that were replaced. However, you're not necessarily out of options.\n\nIf your mechanic failed to repair the problem with your car, you may be able to get a refund.\n\nStep\n\nAsk to speak to the manager in charge of the repair shop or establishment where you took your car to be worked on.\n\nStep\n\nIntroduce yourself to the manager in a calm and collected manner, and explain the problem. Tell him what the original problem with the car was, what work the mechanic performed on it and explain that the problem is still there.\n\nStep\n\nTell the manager what resolution you would like. Before asking for your money back, you may want to allow the shop a second opportunity to fix the problem, at no charge to you. However, if you're so unhappy with the mechanic's work or attitude that you want nothing more to do with the establishment, ask the manager to refund your money. At this point, the manager will either oblige or refuse the refund request. He will most likely offer a partial refund, asking you to pay just the cost of the part but returning any service charges.\n\nStep\n\nExplain what steps you're prepared to take if you don't get your money back. For instance, you might tell him that you will file a complaint against the company with the local Better Business Bureau or the local Chamber of Commerce. You might even threaten to file a suit in small claims court against the company. Don't make threats you're not prepared to carry out.\n\nStep\n\nReport the company to both the Chamber of Commerce and BBB if at this point you still have not received a refund. If the cost of the unnecessary repair was very expensive, then consider filing a lawsuit to recover your money. Many states have all the forms needed online to file a lawsuit in small claims court, so you don't need to hire a lawyer, although if the cost of an attorney is not an issue and you're suing on principle, then retain an attorney to make the legal process easier for you."}
{"title": "The Science of Jury Selection: How Jury Consultants Impact Trials", "text": "In the film Runaway Jury, a professional jury consultant meticulously analyzes the responses, mannerisms, and behaviors of potential jurors to help a civil attorney select jury that will provide a favorable verdict for a major trial. The movie depicts a character who will is willing to discard all scruples to get a win. This depiction is a dramatization, of course, but the job of a jury or trial consultant is a very real career within criminology.Big trials have big consequences, and both sides will often spare no expense to make sure that they give themselves the edge in any court proceeding. With the huge payout potential of major civil trials and grave consequences of criminal trials, there is perhaps no more important aspect of a court case than the selection and monitoring of a jury. That's where trial consultants earn their keep.Job Functions and Work EnvironmentJury consultants work very closely with attorneys throughout criminal and civil trials. They not only assist in selecting juries, but they also spend a great deal of time preparing attorneys and their clients for trial.Most often, they work for private consulting firms, such as Courtroom Sciences, Inc, which was founded by television host Dr. Phil McGraw. These consulting firms contract their services to clients across the country.In the period building up to trial, jury consultants will conduct mock trials in order to help lawyers, witnesses and defendants to get a picture of how the trial will go, what to expect from the opposing counsel, and what kind of verdict they can expect.The job of a jury or trial consultant often includes:Studying human behaviorStudying and analyzing mannerismsAnalyzing verbal responsesAnalyzing nonverbal communications and body languagePreparing reportsCommunicating with and advising attorneysMaking and defending decisionsConducting mock trialsAfter the mock trial, jury consultants will advise attorneys in the jury selection process. They will develop questions to ask potential jurors and provide advice on whether to retain or dismiss them based upon their responses and behavior.In high-stakes trials, attorneys will put a great deal of stock in the advice they receive from their consultants during this phase. They put a great deal of stock into the opinions of trial consultants because a favorable jury will almost always be the difference maker in a successful trial.During the trial phase, jury consultants will often observe the individual jurors and assist their client in identifying how receptive jurors are being to their arguments and tactics. They may provide advice on how to better tune their arguments to elicit a more favorable reaction from jurors.Education and Skill RequirementsJuries are made up of people, so of course, individual biases play a big role in their decision-making process. As such, it takes an expert on human behavior to understand what and how a potential jury may think and act.In light of this fact, jury consultants must have, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree in psychology or behavioral sciences. An advanced degree is preferred, though, and may be required in order to break into the field.Jury consultants are professionals psychologists who work within the larger field of forensic psychology. Most hold a doctorate or have extensive experience in the field of behavioral science and study of human behavior.With a bachelor's or master's degree, people seeking careers as jury consultants will want to build a strong resume working with other psychologists. Working in a research institution or as an assistant to a consultant is a viable path to becoming a professional consultant.Most important to the job of a jury consultant is the ability to interpret, understand and analyze human behaviors, thoughts and feelings. With this understanding, trial consultants must be able to assess how individual people will react to information and delivery styles and how they will render decisions.Job Growth and Salary OutlookThere will always be trials, so there will always be a need for trial consultants. Jury consulting is a relatively small industry, but growth has been steady over the last several decades.

The society now boasts more than 500 members.Jury consultants can earn more than $100,000 annually. They typically provide contractual services that may include a large hourly rate. They may also charge a flat rate depending on the service rendered. In either case, the job of a jury consultant can be quite lucrative.Is a Career As a Jury Consultant Right for You?Becoming a jury consultant takes hard work and a great deal of studying. Because it is a small industry with a big potential payout, you need to set yourself apart as one of the best in your field.Academic success and achievement will be paramount. A career as a jury consultant may perfect for those looking for a criminology career who enjoy behavioral analysis and problem solving, and your hard work may pay dividends in the end."}
{"title": "How to Dispute Visa Debit Charges", "text": "A Visa debit card is a convenient, easy-to-use alternative to credit cards. Unlike a credit card, your Visa debit card is connected to a bank account. Thus, the amount you spend using the debit card is limited to the amount you have in your bank account. Like a credit card, though, Visa does offer some protection to users of its debit card. In fact, according to Visa's Zero Liability guarantee, you will be protected from any fraudulent charges associated with your debit card.\n\nIt's important that you report any incorrect charges to your debit card as soon as possible.\n\nStep\n\nCall the place of business if you authorized the transaction but discovered that you were overcharged or charged for the same item multiple times. Often, if you're able to prove the error, most businesses will take steps to correct the problem. If the business is unable or unwilling to remedy the problem or if you're dealing with an unauthorized transaction, proceed to Step 2.\n\nStep\n\nCall the bank or financial institution that issued the Visa debit card. Be prepared to give your name, account number and detailed explanation of the problem. If your card has been stolen or lost, you will need to cancel the debit card.\n\nStep\n\nFill out any paperwork required by the bank/financial institution. The type and amount of paperwork will vary from bank to bank. In most instances, though, you will need to make a trip to the bank in order to complete the forms in person. If your card has been stolen and you're experiencing fraudulent charges, you may even be advised to fill out a police report.\n\nStep\n\nWait. Visa will have up to 60 days to investigate your claim. Usually, you will receive a credit for the amount of the disputed charge within a few days of the claim. If your claim is upheld, you will be permitted to keep the credit. If, however, Visa denies your claim, you will lose the credit."}
{"title": "Fed will keep its hands off the steering wheel", "text": "Wall Street is certain that the Federal Reserve will keep short-term interest rates unchanged when the rate-setting committee meets Jan. 27 and 28. That certainty is most clearly expressed in Chicago, far from New York's Wall Street. The Chicago Board of Trade's futures market has priced in a 100 percent chance that the federal funds rate, also known as the overnight rate, will remain 1 percent, where it has been since June. Observers believe it is likely to stay at 1 percent for months. \"The Fed will remain on the sidelines until late 2004,\" predicts Doug Duncan, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. How the Fed affects rates\nThe prime rate, which moves in lock step with the federal funds rate, will remain at 4 percent. Rates for many auto loans, credit cards and home equity lines of credit are pegged to the prime rate, and they will remain largely unchanged. Rates for 15- and 30-year mortgages don't respond directly to short-term rates. Instead, they move up and down with 10-year Treasury yields, which in turn move up and down with Wall Street's view of the broader economic outlook. The disappointing employment report for December, in which the government estimated that the economy produced just 1,000 new jobs that month, caused Treasury yields and mortgage rates to drop, even as short-term rates remained the same. Members of the Fed's rate-setting Open Market Committee have hinted for months that they don't plan to raise rates for a while. In its post-meeting statements, the committee has been saying since August that it can keep rates low \"for a considerable period.\" That has been interpreted as meaning that the Fed will raise short-term rates eventually, but only after dropping obvious hints for a few months. How the Fed drops hints\nThose hints will come in two forums: in Fed officials' speeches and congressional testimony, and in changes in the wording of the post-meeting statements. So far, the speeches have not suggested an increase in interest rates anytime soon. Rates are low because inflation is low, which comes in response to rapidly improving worker productivity. Fed officials keep hammering this point, and Roger Ferguson, vice chairman of the Fed, even gave a lengthy speech this month about the history of past productivity booms and what it means for the current one. Some economists point out that the federal budget deficit is projected to reach $500 billion this year and get even bigger in the future. Theoretically, that could \"crowd out\" credit availability, causing interest rates to rise. The Fed has signaled that it won't raise short-term interest rates in response to budget deficits. Not my job\nDonald Kohn, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, said in a speech this month that the government deficits are \"worrisome,\" and that it's a problem for Congress and the executive branch to fix by bringing taxes and spending more closely in line. \"This is not a task for monetary policy,\" he said. The Fed is in charge of monetary policy. \"Our manipulation of the overnight interest rate helps to keep the overall economy in balance -- promoting price stability and production at the economy's potential,\" Kohn said. \"Promoting savings is a job for fiscal and tax policy.\" The Fed could promote savings by raising interest rates. But Kohn said that's not the Fed's job. He wouldn't say if his colleagues disagreed.\nadvertisement"}
{"title": "Is there money in day trading futures? Find out.", "text": "If you've wondered about the potential of day trading futures, then the following scenarios will show you what a risk controlled strategy could make. How much is made will vary by the market environment. During volatile times, when price moves are bigger, there's greater potential; when price moves are smaller there's typically less potential each day. Performance also varies by trader and is affected by the risk/reward of each trade, win rate and how many trades are taken.Futures Day Trading Risk ManagementEvery successful futures day trader manages their risk; it's one of, if not the, most crucial elements of profitability.Keep risk on each trade very small, 1% or less is typical. This means if you have a $30,000 account you shouldn't lose more than $300 on a single trade. Losses occur, and even a good day trading strategy will see strings of losses.Risk is managed using a stop loss order, discussed in the Scenarios sections below.Futures Day Trading StrategyWhile a strategy has potentially many components and can be analyzed for profitability in various ways, it's often ranked based on its win-rate and reward/risk ratio.Win-rate is how many trades are won out of a given number. If you win 55 out of 100 trades the win rate is 55%. While it isn't required, having a win rate above 50% is ideal for most day traders. 55% to 60% is acceptable and attainable.Reward/risk determines how much is risked to attain a profit. If a trader loses 5 ticks on a losing trade, but makes 8 ticks on their winning trades,even if they only win 50% of their trades they'll be profitable. Therefore, making more on winners is also a strategy component many futures day traders strive for.A higher win-rate means more flexibility with your reward/risk, and a high reward/risk means your win-rate can be lower and you can still be profitable.Scenario: How Much Money Can I Make Day Trading Futures?Assume a trader has $7,000 in capital and a 55% win-rate. They risk only 1% of their capital ($70) per trade. This is accomplished by using a stop loss. For this scenario, a stop loss order is placed 5 ticks away from the entry price, and a target is placed 8 ticks away.Trading one E-mini S&P 500 futures (ES), the risk on the trade is 5 x $12.5 = $62.5, which is less than our $70 max risk, and leaves some room for commission costs. A winning trade on one contract equals $100, or 8 x $12.50. Commissions will be dealt with later.This means that the potential reward on each trade is 1.6 times great than the risk (8/5); we want winners to be bigger than losers. This is the reward/risk ratio taught to new students at the Day Trading Academy, and it works well.Assume that volatility permits a trader to make five round turn trades per day (round turn includes an entry and exit) using the above parameters. If there are 20 trading days in a month, the trader is making 100 trades, on average, in a month.Now, let's see how much a futures day trader can make in a month:55 trades were profitable: 55 x $100 = $5,50045 trades were losers: 45 x ($62.5) = ($2,812.5)Gross profit is $5,500 - $2,812.50 = $2,687.5 Assume commissions and fees of $4.12 per round-turn trade.Net profit is $2,687.50 - $412 = $2,275.50 Assuming a net profit of $2,275.50, the return on the account for the month is 32.5% ($2,275.50/$7,000). This may seem very high, and it is a very good return. See Refinements below to see how this return may be affected. Had you risked 2% per traded, which would allow you to trade two contracts per trade using the same $7000 account, the return would be double: 65% (assuming same trading stats). See How to Determine Proper Futures Position Size.RefinementsIt isn't always possible to find five good day trades a day, especially when the market is moving very slowly for extended periods of time. It's also possible that during low volatility times attaining the eight tick target isn't even possible, which means some trades will be exited for a smaller gain. The same is also true for losses, though; a trader exercising discretion over their trades may not always lose the full five ticks. Slippage is an inevitable part of trading. It occurs when a larger loss than expected occurs, even when using a stop loss order. In liquid markets, such as the E-mini S&P 500, slippage isn't usually a major concern.Adjust this scenario accordingly based on your stop and target, capital, slippage, win rate, position sizes, and commissions. How Much Money Can I Make Day Trading Futures? - Final WordThis simple risk-controlled strategy indicates that with a 55% win rate, and making more on winners than is lost on losers, it's possible to attain returns north of 20% per month day trading futures. Most traders shouldn't expect to make this much; while it sounds easy, in reality, it's more difficult. Even so, with a decent win rate and reward/risk ratio a dedicated retail futures day trader with a decent strategy should be able to make more than 10% month. Not a lot of capital is needed to trade futures; in this scenario, $7,000 was used."}
{"title": "Can You Overdraft on a Debit Card?", "text": "When you make a debit card purchase that exceeds the balance in your checking account, you experience an overdraft on your account. You have several options to avoid overdraft charges or to minimize them.\n\nAdult male inserting his debit card into the ATM machine\n\ncredit: Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty Images\n\nOverdraft Basics\n\nWhen you try to purchase a new video game for $50 using a debit card on an account with a $30 balance, you're setting yourself up for an overdraft. Assuming your account allows overdraft charges, the purchase is completed and your account goes negative by $20. Plus, you likely face an overdraft service charge of up to $35, according to \"Consumer Reports.\" If you make multiple overdraft purchases with your card, you may face multiple overdraft fees, depending on your bank's policy.\n\nProtection Strategies\n\nA simple strategy is to decline overdraft services with your bank. With this option, your purchase is declined when you don't have the funds, and you aren't hit with a fee. Another option is to tie your checking account to a savings account from which any overdrafts are pulled. You're still charged a fee for the transaction, but \"Consumer Reports\" indicates it's normally just $5 to $10. Other options include an overdraft line of credit and simply managing your money better to avoid the possibility of an overdraft."}
{"title": "5 Days in Lithuania for Under $600", "text": "Lithuania may not be a top destination for many North Americans, but living in Europe and having a close Lithuanian friend, it was high on my list for a long weekend away. Nestled between Poland, Latvia, Belarus and that small bit of Russia that sits on the Baltic Sea, Lithuania is the southernmost of the three Baltic countries, and the farthest East I have traveled so far in Europe.\n\ncredit: sapling.com\n\nLanding in Kaunas, we didn't stop to explore as we arrived quite late, instead driving to Saukenai, a relatively small village located about 30 minutes from Lithuania's fourth largest city of Siauliai. This is where my friend's parents live, so we scored a free night's lodging. Breakfast was also on the house with her family. We feasted on fresh produce from the garden, eggs from the hens, local sausages, breads, and cheese. While the small farm houses and lake were picturesque, we were soon on our way to our next stop along the Baltic Sea.\n\ncredit: sapling.com\n\nOn our way to the coast, we stopped at the Hill of Crosses \u2013 a local Catholic pilgrimage site and tourist attraction. No one is exactly sure when people started leaving crosses here, but there are thousands in all shapes and sizes. We saw locals coming after their weddings and christenings to leave a cross to mark the occasion. Entry is free, if you want to leave a cross, you can buy one from as little as \u20ac1 ($1.10).\n\ncredit: sapling.com\n\nOur next stop was a traditional Lithuanian Farmhouse restaurant whose lawns contained dozens of carved wooden creatures and thatched buildings. Here we sampled the national dish 'cepelinai' or zeppelins \u2013 a meat-stuffed potato dish topped in a sour cream sauce, as well as other meat and potato dishes and some fried bread with cheese \u2013 the preferred local snack when you're having a beer. Lunch with 2 pints came to \u20ac7.50 ($8.25) a person, and was so filling that we didn't really need much of a dinner later.\n\ncredit: sapling.com\n\nPalanga, the Baltic coast resort, is a traditional 'beach town' made up of bars, restaurants and arcades for the kids. We stayed in a hotel on the main thoroughfare for only \u20ac100 ($110) for room and breakfast as it was off-season. Palanga is reportedly hopping in the summer, but since it was the off-season, people were content casually strolling up and down the promenade by the sea. My largest splurge here was on a mammoth 1 litre cocktail for \u20ac12 ($13.20). Not very alcoholic, but couldn't resist the photo ops!\n\nThe next day we made our way to the capital, Vilnius. Staying just outside of the Gates of Dawn, we were a 2-minute walk from the old town, but didn't pay old town prices. For \u20ac65 ($71.50) a night, our accommodation was basic, but clean, and included breakfast. Vilnius is quite cosmopolitan with streets full of designer shops and top class restaurants. On our first night, we splurged and ate in a trendier restaurant called Dublis. The restaurant has two sections, we ate in the more casual one. The food was tasty and well-presented. One pre-dinner drink, three courses and a shared bottle of wine came to \u20ac50 ($55) per person.\n\ncredit: sapling.com\n\nWe spent our second day in Vilnius being tourists. Vilnius has a beautiful old town peppered with many churches \u2013 both Catholic and Orthodox \u2013 all of which are free to visit. If you only manage to see one, make it the beautiful gothic St. Anne's Church. Local legend has it that Napoleon wanted to take the church back to Paris with him after seeing it during the Franco-Russian war in 1812.\n\nWe also walked to the top of Gediminas' Tower, which is where Gediminas \u2013 one of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania - built his first 'castle', a wooden fortification in the 15th century. Climbing to the top is free, or there is a funicular for \u20ac1 ($1.10) each if you'd prefer. We choose to ride it down to give it a go \u2013 though I'd imagine taking it up would be a better investment. Access to the brick tower at the top is \u20ac5 ($5.50), but I'm not sure it's worth it, as there's not much to see and the hill is already high enough to be a good vantage point for the old town. Our final stop was the Palace of the Grand Dukes at the base of the hill. Entrance fees were \u20ac3 ($3.30) a person. The building was well laid out and delivers a whirlwind tour of Lithuanian history, which admittedly, I knew little about before this visit. The entrance fee is good value for the amount of time you can spend in the building going over all the exhibits.\n\ncredit: sapling.com\n\nOur last stop was Trakai Castle, which is about a 20-minute drive from Vilnius. This is a gorgeous reconstructed medieval castle that sits on an island in the middle of a lake. The \u20ac6 ($6.60) entry fee was well worth it if you're a typical American like me who loves a good castle! The tour outlines the history of the area and the castle, and also includes several exhibits of artefacts from Lithuanian History. We finished up by having lunch in the town \u2013 another \u20ac10 ($11) meal, including drinks \u2013 before heading to the airport and home.\n\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the value Lithuania offered. Great food, warm people, beautiful countryside scenery, and a gorgeous old town in the capital.\n\nTotal Expenditures:\n\nFlights: \u20ac100 ($110) per person Ryanair\n\nRental car & gas: \u20ac85 ($93.5) per person (split by 2)\n\nAccommodation: \u20ac115 ($126.5) per person (split by 2)\n\nFood & drinks: \u20ac215 ($236.5) per person\n\nTourist attractions: \u20ac15 ($16.50)\n\nTop Tips:\n\nEat like the locals and enjoy the local cuisine , as our average meal price with a drink or two was \u20ac10 ($11), though you better like meat and potatoes!\n\nIf you're coming from the States, we'd recommend adding in the rest of the Baltic states to get more bang for your buck. Take advantage of the many low cost airlines to cut down on journey time between destinations."}

{"title": "Owner Financed Foreclosure Rules in Texas", "text": "Owner financed homes are those in which the seller of the property also acts as the bank. In other words, as opposed to a buyer getting a traditional loan from a bank, the seller and buyer will come to an agreement on a payment, interest rate and duration of a loan that the buyer will pay directly to the seller on a monthly basis. There are rules and guidelines set in place if the buyer defaults.\n\nOwners have resources when a buyer doesn't pay.\n\nDefault\n\nOwner financed foreclosures are governed by the same rules and laws in Texas that any lender-owned property is expected to abide by. In other words, there are specific procedures that an owner has to set in place in order to foreclose on a property legally.\n\nTexas is a non-judicial foreclosure state. This means that the owner and resident do not have to appear in court in order to be granted approval to foreclose. However, the owner does have to show all good-faith attempts at collecting prior to foreclosure in the event that the borrower wishes to contest.\n\nThe first thing that the owner must do by law is provide a letter to the resident that serves as an official notice of default. This notice is sent once the homeowner has become 30 or more days late on his mortgage payment. This does not have to be certified, but the owner should retain a copy of the notice.\n\nIntention to Accelerate\n\nApproximately 30 days after the default notice has been sent, the owner must then send, via certified mail, a notice of intention to accelerate. The intention to accelerate states that the owner is calling the full amount of the loan due. For example, if the buyer purchased the property at a sales price of $125,000 and currently owes $123,000, the notice of acceleration would call the entire amount of the $123,000 due.\n\nOnce the notice has been sent, the owner can file with the county courts for a foreclosure date.\n\nNotice of Foreclosure\n\nThe owner must provide the resident with the notice of foreclosure at least 21 days prior to the foreclosure sale. The notice of foreclosure serves as the final demand for payment and the official notice that the property is being repossessed. This notice will have a date set for the foreclosure and inform the residents that they are expected to vacate the premises by the conclusion of the foreclosure auction.\n\nIn Texas, foreclosure auctions are held on the first Tuesday of every month. The auction is done by \"public outcry,\" either at the county clerk's office or in front of the property being auctioned. However, the owner is not obligated to sell the property if no one bids high enough for the property. The owner can retain ownership and property rights to the property and resell it later if he chooses. However, at the end of the auction the deed and rights to the property are transferred to the new owner and the rights that the prior resident had are extinguished."}

{"title": "Is There Legitimate Debt Assistance Available?", "text": "Question: How Can I Find Debt Assistance?Answer: Many people want help with debt assistance when they find themselves unable to make all of the monthly minimum payments on their credit cards and other bills. Often people think that debt assistance will help to lower their payments and relieve them of their debt. People will go to credit counseling services to receive debt assistance as well.It is important to realize that there is no easy solution to fix your debt problem. Paying off your debt or declaring bankruptcy is the only way to get rid of debt. Bankruptcy has a lasting negative effect on your credit score. It can cripple you in many ways and should only be considered as a last resort.  You will need to find a good bankruptcy attorney to help you through this process. Additionally, credit-counseling services also leave a negative mark on your credit score. They may not help you to address the problems that led to your debt in the first place. Many are not legitimate and you should be very careful if you choose to use a credit counseling service.The best thing you can do is to help yourself get out of debt. This is the only way to solve the problem for the long term. You need to begin by following a monthly budget where you spend less than you make each month. Then you need to set up a debt payment plan, and apply extra payments to your debts one at a time until you have paid off all of your debts. If you are disciplined you will be surprised at how quickly you can get out of debt.Debt consolidation loans are also difficult, because while they may lower your interest rate or your monthly debt payment you do not address the spending problems that led to the debt in the first place. Many people who do debt consolidation loans find themselves owing even more money in the future.If you feel that you need a financial expert or additional advice on how to budget your money and get out of debt, consider visiting a financial planner. There are financial planners that specialize in helping you budget, and form a long-term plan with getting out of debt and then investing and saving your money. These planners usually charge by the hour, but it may give you the extra help that you need to get back on track. This type of planner is generally not associated with a credit counseling service.If you have old debts or debts that you are behind on, you may consider trying to settle the debts with the company. To do this you will need to save up an amount to offer them to accept as settlement. When they do this, a credit card company will forgive the rest of the debt. You should receive this agreement in writing before you send the money. Additionally you will be responsible for paying taxes on the money that was forgiven at the end of the year.You may also consider joining a financial support group or taking a class such as though offered by Dave Ramsey. Groups like this will focus on giving encouragement and creating a plan to help you get out of debt. This may provide additional motivation if you are serious about getting out of debt."}
{"title": "Recyclebank&#39;s Javier Flaim on Recycling Contamination", "text": "No surprise, contamination of recyclables is a big problem, and has come under the microscope due to responses from the marketplace such as Operation Green Fence. As part of its monthly educational initiative, Recyclebank recently shared some information on how the contamination of recyclable materials can happen and how it can be stopped. Emphasized were the importance of becoming familiar with what can and cannot be recycled in your city, and the importance of keeping recyclable materials dry and clean.  To dig a little deeper into the topic of contamination as it pertains to recycling, I caught up with Javier Flaim, CEO of Recyclebank. (To read my previous earlier interview with Javier Flaim, click here.)1. What is your background and how does it relate to this issue?My background is primarily around two core skills: innovation and consumer insights/behavior change \u2013 two areas I believe that are necessary dynamics needed to make a difference in the area of waste in America \u2013 and, related, around the issue of contamination.  Recycling rates in the U.S. have remained stubbornly low \u2013 hovering in the low-to-mid 30 percent range over the past decade \u2013 and while we are seeing improvements, we believe that at its core, education needs to be a central component of making a difference \u2013 together with community efforts, infrastructure improvements, and private sector involvement.  And these days, making sure that the right recyclables go into the right streams is even more critical \u2013 hence our need for continuing to evolve and innovate on how we can best educate and motivate residents to do their part to make a significant difference.       2. How does contamination throw a wrench into effective recycling? What happens when the wrong stuff is put into the bin? Is this worse than tossing it into the trash bin?Waste is unfortunately complex in the U.S., and thus potentially confusing to many consumers.  Different communities accept different recyclables \u2013 and sometimes what\u2019s accepted is even different within communities (e.g., at a stadium vs. at an office building vs. at home.)  Moreover, new materials are being introduced every day, new infrastructure are brought online and updates to local rules/regulations continue to evolve \u2013 all making recycling potentially more and more complex. So it\u2019s not surprising that there is \u201ccontamination\u201d in the recycling stream \u2013 or more simply put, \u201c placing wrong stuff\u201d into the recycling bin.   There are a number of problems that occur when there is contamination.  For example, it could tangle the sorting equipment at a recycling facility, also known as a Materials Recovery Facility (or MRF), and cause significant damage to the machinery.  A common and harmful contaminant is plastic bags \u2013 many if not most cities do not accept plastic bags at the curb as they are harmful to the recycling process and can damage the conveyor belts and sorters that are in-use at these facilities (though plastic bags can likely be dropped off at your local supermarket or grocery store to be recycled).  Other recycling contamination can also lead to unsafe conditions for workers.  And ultimately, contamination can diminish the quality and financial value of the recycled materials \u2013 hurting haulers, cities \u2013 and ultimately your pocket books.  The best thing to do is check with your city or hauler on what is or isn\u2019t accepted at the curb or drop off centers.  A few simple rules may help: (1) keep it dry (2) don\u2019t put plastic bags in recycling stream and (3) keep it clean/rinse things out.  One can use many of the resources available (city website, or resources like the Recyclebank website and Mobile APP) to learn more and search what is and isn\u2019t recyclable in your community.  3. What can households do to ensure that they put the right stuff in bins?There are a number of resources available to residents whether through their local hauler who manages their trash/recycling/compost curbside pick-ups or perhaps the municipality/city themselves, such as on the city website page.  It\u2019s always best to verify what is and isn\u2019t accepted in their community as recyclable.  There are a number of other resources, such as Recyclebank, that have articles, quizzes, slideshows, videos and other information to help residents and consumers get a better understanding of waste, recycling, contamination \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 why it matters to them, their community and the world at large.4. How can communities better communicate and motivate households to put the right stuff in the recycling bin? How does Recyclebank fit into this mix?We realize that recycling may not be top-of-mind for a number of residents \u2013 and other priorities can come in the way of someone\u2019s desire to research, learn and understand more about waste and recycling.  That\u2019s why we believe some consumers need that \u201cnudge\u201d to get them to pay extra attention to reducing their waste, recycling more, and recycling correctly.  Recyclebank leverages behavioral science best practices in order to maximize results, utilizing tools such as points & rewards, expert content, challenges, sweepstakes, alerts/notifications, multi-channel marketing initiatives, community-based marketing activities and other such tactics.  This is an area where one tactic won\u2019t suffice to truly make an impact \u2013 and we need to not only leverage these behavior change best practices \u2013 but also partner with cities, haulers, and private sector to truly affect change."}
{"title": "How to Make Sure You Get Paid for Work - What to Do If You Don&#39;t", "text": "Freelancers and those who work as independent contractors often have trouble getting paid. This includes all types of contract workers who are self-employed and rely on income from others to keep going. If you are starting a freelance business, one of the first things you will need to do - after figuring out how to get paying clients - is to deal with the issues relating to payment. Here are some tips to make sure you get paid for your work. There are two parts to this process - first, getting payment then what to do if you don't get paid.First, a caveat: There are some people who will never pay you, no matter how much you try. It's best to figure out these people right away, before expending a significant amount of time and energy on them. Getting a contract and accepting payments1. Get it in writing. Get details of the work requirements. Don't rely on assumptions. That means putting together a contract or work for hire agreement (they are essentially the same thing). Define the work specifically and include specific details on when you will get paid, how much, and what happens it one party doesn't fulfill the terms of the contract. IIt doesn't take long to put together an independent contractor agreement, and it's better to get everything in writing than have major conflicts over assumptions.2. Wait for that first payment. Don't do a significant amount of work without getting paid and verifying that the first payment is not going to bounce. Don't let pressure from the client deter you from waiting. You don't want to waste a lot of your time if that first payment is not good.3. Don't accept checks. Checks may take several days to clear, and you might be doing work only to find out the check bounced. If you have a long-term agreement with a client who pays you faithfully by check, you can slide this rule.4. Use safe, secure, and verifiable payment methods, like PayPal. You can also accept credit cards on PayPal, and this cheaper than trying to figure out how to accept credit cards through your own website.5.Get advance payments. Don't wait until the work is complete - get an advance. Or, spread out the payments through the term of the contract. You can get paid something up front, then at key points throughout the work (thirds, or quarters, maybe). A final payment at the end before the client is shown the final work product can help make sure you get everything you are owed. This is a matter of negotiation, because the client will want to pay only at the end, but separate payments are good for everyone.6. Work through reputable services. When you are just starting out, these services may be helpful in getting clients. In addition, they have to some degree vetted these clients. I'm talking about companies like \u200beLance, \u200b\u200b99designs or oDesk. Sure, they will take a portion of your payment, but you can be more sure of getting paid. And you can develop your own clients from the references you gain as you go.What to do if you don't get paid1. Decide at what point you will stop doing the work and notify the contractor of your decision to stop work. At some point in a relationship with a client, you may have to send a notice that unless the money owed is paid you will stop work. It's a tough \u200bcall \u200band depends on the relationship and possibility of future work. But, on the other hand, do you want to continue to work for someone who is slow in paying or whose checks always bounce?3. Begin the collections process. When you go into business, one of the things you will need to decide is how you will collect money from clients or customers who don't pay. You should set up a collections system to watch accounts receivable (money owed to you by clients), send out reminders, and determine your collections methods if you don't get paid. As with all management decisions, waiting until you have a lot of unpaid bills yourself and then rushing around going after those who owe you is not the best solution to this problem."}

When the finance company contacted her to say you defaulted, it was probably up to her to either take responsibility to pay the loan or find her credit adversely affected.

{"title": "What Every Investor Should Know About Share Price and Stock Splits", "text": "Time for an investing pop-quiz.  If you had $1,000 to invest and were given the choice between buying 100 shares of company ABC at $10 per share, or 5 shares of company XYZ at $125, which would you choose? Many investors would go for the one hundred shares of ABC because the share price is lower. \"The $10 stock looks cheap,\" they argue, \"the $125 per share price for the other stock is too risky and rich for my taste.\"If you agree with this reasoning, you're in for a shock. The truth is, you don't have enough information to determine which stock should be purchased based on share price alone. You may find, after careful analysis, the $125 stock is cheaper than the $10 stock! How? Let's take a closer look.Share Price and Stock Splits - The Coca-Cola ExampleEvery share of stock in your portfolio represents a fractional ownership in a business. In 2001, Coca-Cola earned $3.696 billion in profit. The soft drink giant had approximately 2.5 billion shares outstanding. This means that each of those shares represents ownership of 1/2,500,000,000 of the business (or 0.0000000004%) and entitles you to $1.48 of the profits ($3.696 profit divided by 2.5 billion shares = $1.48 per share).Assume that the company's stock trades at $50 per share and Coca-Cola's board of directors thinks that is a bit too pricey for average investors. As a result, they announce a stock split. If Coke announced a 2-1 stock split, the company would double the amount of shares outstanding (in this case the number of shares would increase to 5 billion from 2.5 billion). The company would issue one share for each share an investor already owned, cutting the share price in half (e.g., if you had 100 shares at $50 in your portfolio on Monday, after the split, you would have 200 shares at $25 each). Each of the shares is now only worth 1/5,000,000,000 of the company, or 0.0000000002%. Due to the fact that each share now represents half of the ownership it did before the split, it is only entitled to half the profits, or $0.74.The investor must ask himself which is better - paying $50 for $1.48 in earnings, or paying $25 for $0.74 in earnings? Neither! In the end, the investor comes out exactly the same. The transaction is akin to a man with a $100 bill asking for two $50's. Although it now looks like he has more money, his economic reality hasn't changed. This, incidentally, should prove it is pointless to wait for a stock split before buying shares of a company.Share Price Relative to ValueThis all serves to make one very important point: share price by itself means nothing. It is share price in relation to earnings and net assets that determines if a stock is over or undervalued.Going back to the question I posed at the beginning of this article, assume the following:Company ABC is trading at $10 per share and has EPS of $0.15.Company XYZ is trading at $125 per share and has EPS of $35.The ABC stock is trading at a price to earnings ratio (p/e ratio) of 67 ($10 per share divided by $0.15 EPS = 66.67). The XYZ stock, on the other hand, is trading at a p/e of 3.57 ($125 per share divided by $35 EPS = 3.57 p/e).In other words, you are paying $66.67 for every $1 in earnings from company ABC, while company XYZ is offering you the same $1 in earnings for only $3.57. All else being equal, the higher multiple is unjustified unless company ABC is expanding rapidly.Some companies have a policy of never splitting their shares, giving the share price the appearance of gross overvaluation to less-informed investors. The Washington Post, for example, has recently traded between $500 and $700 per share with EPS of over $22. Berkshire Hathaway has traded as high as $70,000 per share with EPS of over $2,000. Hence, Berkshire Hathaway, if it fell to $45,000 per share, may be a far better buy than Wal-Mart at $70 per share. Share price is entirely relative.More Information About Investing in StocksYou can read more about investing in shares of stock in our Complete Investor's Guide to Investing in Stock."}
{"title": "Paying for Music Distribution: A Careful Consideration", "text": "Music distribution companies charge you for their services. They may offer to provide a certain level of service - such as getting X number of albums in Y number of stores - and may offer you access to a particular record store. But should you ever take them up on their offer?This kind of business structure for a music distribution company is perfectly legal, but it is akin to the model who pays to get on an agent's books. These companies can get your music into stores, but there are a few reasons why you should think carefully before committing:Downsides to Paying for Music DistributionMusic distribution already costs money. A music distributor takes a cut of your album sales - that's how traditional distributors makes money. Part of the benefit of this arrangement is that the distributor not only has reason to get the record stores to stock copies of the album, they also have an added incentive to actively work with the stores to get the albums promoted on site - whether through special placement, sales or in-store plays. If you're not paying the distributor for their services upfront, then they need you to sell records if they're going to get paid.Getting albums into record shops is only part of the battle. Moving your album off the shelf and into the hands of the customers is what counts. As an indie artist or label, you need to work hard to promote your release to build awareness. When money is tight, if you divert precious cash from promotion to pay for distribution, your record might be in stores, but no one will know about it.Generating a poor track record with sales can hurt you in the long term. If your CD doesn't sell and sits buried among the thousands of competitors, the record store may take fewer units of your  next  CD, even refusing to stock it altogether. You'll need to do some hard selling next time around since a brand new artist can generate more excitement in the retail marketplace than a musician with record that's bombed.Distribution Services Without an Upfront FeeIf you're simply looking for someone to put your album in stores, there are distribution services that gladly work with all labels without charging an upfront fee. These services make your product available - they do not actively sell your album, so they can't guarantee that it will be on the shelves. That might sound less appealing than paying for your album to be placed in stores, but unless you have the promotion in place to stimulate sales, it's really not. Of course, working with these distributors is certainly less desirable than landing a distribution deal with a label that loves your music and has a label manager on the phone pushing your album into stores.Learn More about Music Distribution:Find Music DistributionLicensing versus DistributionM&D DealsDigital DistributionPlease note that this is general information, individual circumstances may differ and it is not intended to take the place of legal advice."}
{"title": "Getting name off mortgage post-bankruptcy", "text": "mortgage\nDear Bankruptcy Adviser,\nMy wife and I divorced in 2011. Afterward I had to file bankruptcy. Included in the bankruptcy was my mortgage loan. My ex stayed in the house for a few months until she found a new place. I assumed once I went through bankruptcy and the mortgage was discharged that the debt then fell to my ex exclusively. Now she is saying that I need to sign a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Is it necessary for me to do so, or is this her issue to deal with alone? Would it further hurt me to sign this deed after I filed bankruptcy?\n-- Pete\nDear Pete,\nYou are correct to assume that the bankruptcy discharge eliminated your liability on the mortgage. As long as you did not reaffirm the mortgage loan while your case was active, the discharge means the lender can't come after you for the unpaid mortgage balance; that the county can't come after you for unpaid property taxes; and that the insurance company can't come after you for unpaid homeowners insurance premiums.\nYour ex-wife may be asking you to sign a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for other reasons. A deed-in-lieu of foreclosure means that you are relinquishing the title of the house back to the lender before the lender forecloses on the property. If the lender is willing to do this (most lenders aren't), it expedites the process of returning the house to the lender and getting the property entirely out of your name.\nIn some cases, lenders are taking years to complete a foreclosure. So transferring a title back to the lender more quickly allows you to get the property out of your name and begin the credit recovery process sooner. In general, new lenders state that you must wait a minimum of two years from the date of foreclosure to buy another home. You are being given the opportunity to start that two-year period sooner.\nSome people may wonder why the bankruptcy did not remove your name from the title or the mortgage loan. The bankruptcy only wipes out your liability on the mortgage, but it does not remove your name from the mortgage loan or the title to the property. To do that, the property must either be transferred back to the bank or refinanced out of your name. Until either of those two options happen, you are still the legal owner of the property even if you don't have any legal obligation to pay for the property.\nAt this point, I can't see any negative consequences of signing your name off the title and expediting the return of the property to the lender. You don't want anything to do with the property, so the sooner it is out of your name, the better."}

{"title": "How to Stop Killing Your Small Business", "text": "There's good business. And then there's bad business, the kind of business practices that will lose you customers and win you nothing but complaints and badmouthing.If you want to grow your small business or even keep the clients and/or customers you have now, you never want to:1) Be personally offensive.It's not just about image; it's about behavior. You can be perfectly dressed for the job at hand but if you have a sewer mouth, make racist or sexist remarks, or stink like a goat, you're going to lose a lot of business.And if you actually urinate in a bucket in a customer's garage, as one garage door installer did in a televised episode of Marketplace, you might as well leave town.2) Not answer the phone \u2013 or, if you run a home business, let a small child answer it.In a time when everyone seems to have a phone sticking out of their pocket, there's no excuse for not answering a call, one way or another. Have your hands full of plywood sheeting or in a meeting with a client? That's what secretaries, answering machines, call forwarding or voice mail are for.Customers are not like your Mom; they're not going to keep calling even if you don't pick up because they\u2019re worried about you.How to Answer the Phone Properly lays out the rules that everyone in your small business should be following.3) Need to use the customer's tools or equipment.Showing up to clean gutters without your own ladder. Or showing up to install a floor and asking your customer if he has a saw you can borrow. You might as well just tattoo \"fly by night\" on your forehead and be done with it. People with real businesses and real expertise have their own tools.4) Refuse to listen to clients or customers.You may have years of experience and enough certifications and awards to paper a whole wall of your office, and certainly know best. So what?That's why they hired you and it may be why they fire you if they feel you're not hearing what they have to say and going to give them what they want. Sure, blue is the \"in\" color this year. But if the client wants green, listen and adapt.5) Leave a job unfinished and/or don't bother to clean up after you\u2019ve done the job.Do you expect a customer to be pleased with your work when the job isn't done? Do you think a customer will be sure to praise your work to all her friends when you've left debris all over their kitchen or lawn? Really? Not likely. Even when you're really pressed to get to the next job, you need to push down the feeling, rearrange your schedule and make sure you get the job in front of you done right first.6) Not try to fix a problem related to your product and/or service.Sometimes problems are truly things that you can do nothing about. But you can still \"show willing\" and listen to the customer's complaint and, in the best case scenario, give them some action they can take, whether it be contacting the manufacturer or complaining to their municipality.If it's in your purview, though, you need to make it right, as Mike Holmes says. It's important in terms of future business and potential referrals. (Learn how to ask for referrals here.)7) Bring dogs and let them run around the customer's yard and/or house.Dogs are like children \u2013 not everyone loves them. Especially as dogs, unlike children, have some less than endearing habits such as pressing their noses into people\u2019s crotches and defecating on people\u2019s lawns. And customers may have allergies to dogs or pets of their own that are not compatible with yours. Never take your pet to a job site without having cleared it with the customer first.8) Make inaccurate estimates.If you're not good at estimating how much a particular product or service will cost and/or how long it will take to finish a job or project, you really need to work on this skill. Your estimate is part of what will win you the work. Not being able to estimate the cost and time a job will take accurately breeds poor client relationships. Customers don't see it as you being inaccurate. They see it as you lying to them.Here are five ways to keep your relationships with clients smooth and untroubled.9) Send out an assistant to do your job.Always keep in mind that clients have hired you, not an assistant or underling. They want you working on their case or project or job. Depending on what you do, you can get away with having an assistant do some parts of a job as long as you clearly supervise that person and/or their work. But you can't send the assistant out to do your job and expect a client to be happy. And sending out a poorly trained or incompetent assistant is suicidal business-wise.10) Be incompetent \u2013 but pretend not to be.Misrepresenting your credentials and/or your abilities is not only a quick way to run yourself out of business but may also lead to criminal charges or being sued. And it really doesn't matter whether or not you had good intentions and were \"just trying to help someone out\" and saving them the cost and trouble of calling in an electrician, a tiler, a drywaller etc. If you are not qualified to do something or have not done it before, you shouldn't be doing it.How Did You Do?If you've never done any of these things in the course of doing business, congratulations! Give yourself and your employees a pat on the back and keep right on doing what you do, creating and attracting even more happy customers.Unfortunately, I bet that when you were reading through the list of bad practices, the names of different businesses that you have dealt with sprang to mind. If so, do those businesses a favor and let them know what they did poorly. Legitimate businesses are always looking to improve their customer service and their business practices."}
{"title": "Administrative Interview Questions About Weaknesses", "text": "When you are applying for an administrative / office position a typical job interview question is \"What is your greatest weakness?\" As with any inquiry about a weakness during an interview, you want to make sure to answer honestly and sincerely, but still paint yourself in a positive light.Advice on Answering \"What's Your Greatest Weakness?\"Avoid giving any response that would make you seem like a poor fit for the position. For instance, if the administrative position will require you to be on the phone frequently, you wouldn't want to respond by saying you have a poor phone manner or accidentally hang up on people when you intend to transfer the call. Responses that make you seem like a poor worker \u2014 for instance, \"I have trouble getting to meetings on time\" or \"I send emails with tons of typos to major clients\" \u2014 should also be avoided.But you'll also want to avoid giving an answer that is arrogant, or clearly dodges the question, such as \"I'm a perfectionist, and just can't rest until all problems are completely resolved\" or \"I'm just too much of a hard worker.\" That type of response doesn't seem genuine or sympathetic.One strategy when answering this question is to use it as an opportunity to show how you're actively working to improve your weakness. Remember the phone example from above? You could possibly respond by saying, \"I have a tendency to get a bit flustered with new phone systems. I get so focused on the phone's functions that I don't engage well with callers. Since it's important to me to sound friendly and approachable on the phone, I created a sticky-note with instructions for how to put calls on hold, transfer, etc \u2014 it's made answering the phone much less stressful, and I can tell my phone manner has improved as a result.\" Examples of the Best AnswersHere are sample interview answers which you can edit to fit your personal experiences and background:I sometimes overdo getting my work done ahead of time. However, I am excellent at meeting deadlines, and with my attention to detail, I know my work is correct. Sometimes, I spend more time than necessary on a task, or have volunteered to take on tasks personally that could easily be handled by someone else in the office.I can get very impatient when people do not deliver work in a timely manner. To avoid feeling frustrated with co-workers, I've learned to establish clear deadlines and give friendly reminders a few days prior to keep projects on track. Although I've never missed a deadline, it is still an effort for me to know when to move on to the next task, and to be confident when assigning others work.I suffer a bit from the \"if you want something done right, do it yourself\" mentality, and have sometimes found it hard to delegate or let others help me on projects. But of course, doing everything yourself is often overwhelming and frustrating. I've learned that dividing up tasks, setting up check-in times, and working as a team can result in great outcomes (and less late nights).I used to like to work on one project to it completion before starting on another, but I've learned to multi-task better. I think it allows me to be more creative and effective in each one.More Strengths and Weaknesses Interview QuestionsHere are interview questions related to your strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and accomplishments, along with examples of answers.Administrative Interview Questions and AnswersMore administrative interview questions and sample answers.More Interview Questions and AnswersQuestions you'll be asked when interviewing, how to prepare answers to interview questions, along with sample answers to typical job interview questions."}
{"title": "Trim Your Taxes With Health Savings Account Contributions", "text": "As the year comes to a close, many people are looking for ways to save on their taxes. One way is through deductions on qualifying expenses. Tax deductions worth considering \u2014 and that many people don\u2019t know about \u2014 are contributions to a health savings account, a tax-advantaged savings vehicle for eligible medical expenses.\nYour HSA contributions are subtracted from your income pre-tax, lowering your adjusted gross income. Your adjusted gross income then determines the total amount of itemized deductions, such as mortgage interest payments and property taxes, you can take.\nBut not everyone is eligible for an HSA. Only individuals and families with high-deductible health insurance plans are allowed to contribute to them. Let\u2019s look at who can contribute and what the contribution limits are:\nIf you are a single individual, and your medical plan has a minimum deductible of $1,300 and maximum out-of-pocket costs of $6,450, you can contribute up to $3,350 to an HSA in a given year. If you are age 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $1,000.\nIf you have a family, and your minimum deductible is $2,600 and your maximum out-of-pocket cost is $12,900, you can contribute $6,650 to your HSA. If you are age 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $1,000.\nHSA perks\nUnlike other deductions, HSA contribution limits and deductions don\u2019t phase out with higher income. And not only are contributions tax-deductible, but they also grow tax-free. You can invest the funds in your HSA in securities such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The distributions you take from your HSA are also tax-free, provided that you use the money for qualified medical expenses. Those include, but are not limited to, doctor copayments, prescriptions, surgical procedures and even some over-the-counter medicines.\nMedical expenses are tax-deductible after they surpass 10% of your adjusted gross income. For instance, if your adjusted gross income is $100,000, the first $10,000 of medical expenses aren\u2019t deductible, but any expenses beyond that are. With contributions to an HSA, you don\u2019t have worry about meeting the 10% threshold because you deduct your contributions, not your expenses.\nYou still have time\nUnlike the HSA cousin, the flexible spending account, you do not have to use all of your contributions in the year that you make them. If you have a family and you contribute the maximum $6,650 to your HSA, and you don\u2019t use it in 2015, you can carry your balance forward into 2016. If you can, it pays to max out your contribution so you can build up your HSA for future use, especially if you anticipate bigger medical expenses in the coming year.\nAnd just because it\u2019s the end of the year doesn\u2019t mean your time is up to contribute to your HSA. Contributions can be made by the due date of your tax return, excluding extensions, and will be deducted for that tax year. For instance, you can make a contribution to your HSA until April 15, 2016, and deduct it from 2015 taxes.\nAs you can see, HSA contributions can be a very powerful tax-saving tool and a smart way to cover your medical expenses. If you have an HSA, make sure you are making the most of it and review your 2015 contributions today.\nImage via iStock."}

{"title": "What Are Restricted and Unrestricted Funds for a Nonprofit?", "text": "UPDATE: FASB standards will change for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. At that time donations will be designated only as unrestricted and restricted. For the details on these changes and others, consult this Nonprofit Quarterly article.DefinitionDonors to a nonprofit organization may designate or \"restrict\" the use of their donations to a particular purpose or project. An example is a gift to a special scholarship fund at a university.\"Unrestricted\" funds are donations the nonprofit may use for any purpose. Unrestricted funds usually go toward the operating expenses of the organization or to a particular project that the nonprofit picks.How Are Restricted Funds Designated?Only the donor can determine if a donation is restricted or not.  The designation can be made by a letter from the donor or through an explicit agreement with the nonprofit. Often grants from foundations are restricted to a particular program or purpose, and that restriction is set out in the documentation that accompanies the award.Most nonprofits ask for unrestricted funds when they solicit donors by email or direct mail. A clause often states this on the donation form and in the gift acknowledgment. Exceptions could be when donors are asked to give to a capital campaign, a building fund, or a scholarship fund.Nonprofits must be clear when asking for gifts.  Some charities have experienced donor backlash when it appeared that donors were donating for a particular purpose only to find out that the charity used their gift in an unrestricted way.One way to avoid confusion is to give donors a choice of designation at the time of the donation. For instance, the American Red Cross on its online donation page offers several options for the donor to direct his donation, such as \u201cDisaster Relief,\u201d \u201cWhere it is needed most,\u201d and \u201cYour Local Red Cross.\u201dMost direct mail solicitations include a statement that implies the donor is giving an unrestricted gift. For instance, Partners In Health included this statement in its letter: \u201cYES! I believe every child has a right to grow up happy and healthy. Here\u2019s my gift to help end the senseless deaths of young children from malnutrition.\u201dWhat Are the Legal Obligations of a Restricted Gift?There are good reasons to be entirely clear about how the charity plans to use the gift when making a solicitation. There is not only a moral obligation for nonprofits to honor a donor\u2019s wishes, but they are also required by law to do so.If a donor restricts a donation to a particular purpose and the nonprofit does not comply, the donor can demand a refund. The donor can take legal action if needed and report the charity to the Office of the Attorney General in the state where the charity resides.The Types of Restricted FundsRestricted gifts fall into two categories, specified in the \u201cgift instrument.\u201d That is the document that determines how the donated funds will be used. The gift instrument might be an award letter from a foundation or a letter from an individual donor.Temporarily RestrictedDonors sometimes impose time-limited restrictions.  Time-restricted means that the donation can be used for a particular purpose for a specified period, or it must support a specific program or campaign. When the time is up, or the project is done, the funds become unrestricted or stopped. Examples include a grant, graduation of a scholarship recipient, or the completion of a building project.Permanently RestrictedPermanently restricted funds never expire. Usually, this means that the charity invests the gift and then uses the interest and investment returns in perpetuity.  Permanently restricted funds often go into an endowment that supports a particular activity or the organization in general.Whatever type of restricted fund is set up, the nonprofit must keep track of it and report it appropriately in its financial statements. Consult the Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) at the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for detailed information."}
{"title": "Should You Buy New or Used Equipment?", "text": "Dear Restaurant Guide,I am getting ready to open my new restaurant in a few weeks. I just got cleared for financing from the bank. Now I am starting to buy equipment for the restaurant kitchen. My business partner and I can\u2019t agree on what type of equipment we should buy. I say we should buy as much used equipment as we can, to save money for all the other start-up costs. He says we should buy new, because it comes with a warranty and if we buy used we will end up spending more on fixing the equipment, down the road or replacing it all together. What should we do?Advantages of New Restaurant EquipmentYou are both right \u2013 to an extent. Purchasing new equipment has an obvious advantage\u2026it\u2019s new. And as your business partner pointed out, it comes with a warranty. However, depending on the type of equipment, it a bit liking buying a car, the minute it leaves the showroom, its value dramatically decreases. Because new restaurants have kind of high failure rate (I know, not what you were looking to hear right now) you can often find purchase quality used restaurant equipment for pennies on the dollar. Bigger, pricy pieces of restaurant equipment, such as stoves, ovens, refrigeration units are also a good deal, when purchased used. Another point to remember about buying used equipment is that prices are not always set in stone. You can often haggle the prices with dealers. So don\u2019t be afraid to ask for a lesser price when looking at used equipment.You can find lots of used restaurant equipment through commercial auction houses. If you go to a restaurant auction, do your homework and find out how long the place was open. Examine the appliances, looking for telltale signs of wear and tear like rust, missing parts, ect. If you are really lucky, you can still get the warranty with a piece that is not too old. Gas ranges, one of the most expensive pieces of commercial kitchen equipment you\u2019ll have to buy, usually have very long life spans and should definitely be considered buying used. Read more about the pros and cons of buying used equipment. Benefits of Leasing Restaurant EquipmentLeasing commercial equipment is another option, when outfitting a new restaurant. Certain pieces of restaurant equipment are better suited to leasing, because of their short life span. They wouldn\u2019t be worth the investment to buy new. These items include ice machines, dishwashers, coffeemakers and coolers. Often times the latter two \u2013 coffeemakers and coolers- will be provided free by your beverage distributor.The last thing I recommend you think about is the size of your overall restaurant, your menu and your kitchen. You may think you need a lot more equipment than you actually do. For example, when I outfitted my last restaurant kitchen, I added in a pricy refrigerated set of drawers to the kitchen line, in addition to the reach in coolers. This was totally unnecessary. In the end we found it more efficient to store the food all in one cooler, rather than a hodgepodge throughout the kitchen. And the drawers were always sticking and ended up breaking (after the warranty, of course).Other Ways to Save Money at Your RestaurantOutside of your restaurant kitchen, there are many places you can save money buying used equipment. While it would be nice if your restaurant was all sparkly and new, just remember, new doesn\u2019t always equate better. Glassware, linens, baskets, flatware are all steals when purchased used. Tables and chairs are also good deals, but can look dated. It all boils down to what you want to spend and what areas you want to spend it on."}
{"title": "4 Reasons Crowdfunding Campaigns Fail And How To Avoid Them", "text": "The lure of crowdfunding is strong: have a great idea, write it up and post it on a leading crowdfunding platform, make a video, and just sit back and begin counting the money that rolls in backing your campaign.The truth is that most campaigns fail. They fail to hit their financial targets. In fact, Kickstarter's success rate sits around 37%. That means just about 1 out of every 3 projects actually succeeds at crowdfunding. The rest lose.While it takes a lot of work and some strokes of luck to win at crowdfunding, there are some misunderstandings about how crowdfunding works. Learn how to avoid these pitfalls on your way to crowdfunding success.4 reasons crowdfunding campaigns don't hit their targets#1) Crowdfunding isn't as easy as it looks: The truth is that crowdfunding takes a lot of planning and a lot of work. Many of the top crowdfunding campaigns -- the kind you read about in the news -- use top marketing and PR agencies to run their crowdfunding campaigns. They spend time and money planning and executing their campaigns. Here are some must-read resources you'll need to run a successful crowdfunding campaign and check out my expert guide on how to rock a crowdfunding campaign. Take your time to plan out your crowdfunding campaign and you're already well on your way.#2) Campaigns fail to get early traction: If crowdfunding requires attention to marketing, the fruits of good planning and execution have to come early in a campaign. The data show that the earlier a campaign can start to build momentum, the more likely it is to reach its goals. Again, according to Kickstarter, 79% of projects that raised more than 20% of their goals were successfully funded. It's much easier to launch with a bang than it is to find it later on. A lot of the early marketing should happen before you ever click 'Publish' on your crowdfunding campaign.Here's what Alon Goren, CEO and co-founder of Invested.in, a white label fundraising portal for individuals and businesses hoping to crowdfund ventures independently of major platforms, had to say about early momentum:Nothing attracts a crowd more than a crowd. If you want to hit your fundraising goal by the end of the campaign, he recommends focusing on raising 30 percent of it in the first two or three days. That's what research shows successful campaigns tend to do.#3) Launching with lackluster rewards programs: Don't make the assumption your backers are putting money into your campaign out of the goodness of their hearts. Sure, there's an emotional connection between crowdfunding backer and creator but backers are in it for the rewards. It's essential that you create an amazing reward program for the backers of your campaign. Incentivize them to back you for getting quality rewards in return. Good campaigns have a variety of rewards around $1, $5, and $10 to get casual supporters involved. Get a few thousands of these smaller backers and you can really create momentum. Also, think about creating stretch goals -- goals everyone can participate in when a campaign hits a certain goal. For example, unlocking a new color of your product is a common technique crowdfunding creators use to get backers excited about participating. #4) Not being prepared to act as a customer service desk: It's common for a campaign to launch and receive hundreds and even thousands of questions, emails, and comments about the campaign, rewards, and the end product. Creators have to be ready and have a plan to deal with the volume of communication that's required of crowdfunding. Successful communication strategies during the campaign have been shown to make a campaign more likely to succeed. Have a plan and communicate openly with your audience. The better you can incorporate your backers and get theme excited about your campaign, the more likely you are to have your campaign go viral (because your audience will want to share it). Crowdfunding campaigns can fail or succeed for all sorts of reasons. Rarely is a crowdfunding campaign successful because it gets lucky. Financial goals are hit by planning and running a successful marketing campaign for a crowdfunding campaign. Don't fall for the common mistakes that cause a crowdfunding campaign to fail."}

{"title": "Rules for ACH Reversal", "text": "ACH stands for Automated Clearing House, which is a processing network for electronic payments. It is commonly used by banks and financial institutions in the United States for transferring funds and debiting banking accounts. The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) requires your financial institution to abide by specific rules for ACH reversals.\n\nBanks must follow certain rules when reversing ACH debit transactions.\n\nAffidavit\n\nWhen requesting your bank to reverse ACH transactions, you are required by law to fill out an affidavit. However, NACHA now refers to the term for affidavit as \"a written statement under penalty of perjury.\" This more accurately describes the requirement and penalty if you are found falsifying information in that written statement.\n\nNo Fees\n\nWhen your financial institution processes an ACH debit reversal, it cannot charge you a fee. According to Regulation E, a set of federal banking rules, it is unlawful and should be reported immediately to the NACHA and other federal banking authorities. The money should be simply reversed after you fill out the affidavit or written statement.\n\nNotice of Error\n\nAs a consumer, you have 60 days from the date your financial institution sends your periodic statement to bring the transaction error to their attention. Notification after this 60-day period does not guarantee a reversal; you may forfeit your right to dispute that charge. Within 10 days of receiving your written notification, the financial institution is responsible for investigating the matter.\n\nAdditional Documentation\n\nYour banking institution may ask for additional documentation or clarification in writing. If your bank requests more information about the disputed charge, you will may have up to an additional 60 days to submit further documentation. However, as a consumer, staying on top of the matter and submitting all required paperwork in a timely manner is vital to a smooth and quick investigation."}
{"title": "Are Liquid Alternative Funds Worth It?", "text": "investing\nAlternative mutual funds: Are they worth it?\nLiquid alternative mutual funds represent one of the fastest growing asset classes around, and many investment experts say they can make a useful addition to your portfolio. The \"alternative\" part of the funds' name reflects their difference from standard long-only stock, bond and commodity funds. In that sense, they are like hedge funds. But the \"liquid\" part sets them apart from hedge funds. Unlike hedge funds, liquid alternative funds can be sold on a daily basis, just like other mutual funds. \"Investors should look at these funds, but you need to look more closely at them than your typical stock fund,\" says Josh Charlson, director of manager research for alternative strategies at Morningstar research firm in Chicago. \"They tend to use more complicated strategies. You need to understand their role in a portfolio.\" Growing numbers Though they are not commonly found in 401(k) plans, the number of liquid alternative funds and the amount of assets they control have soared over the past few years. There are now 465 such funds, up from 242 five years ago. The funds enjoyed a net inflow of $14.64 billion in the first half of the year, according to Morningstar. \"A lot of it (the growth) is a reaction to the (2008-09) financial crisis and the steep losses you saw in portfolios with a lot of exposure to stocks,\" Charlson says. \"There's also a recognition by investors and advisers that to the extent you can smooth out volatility in a portfolio, it leads to a better experience. The option to invest in an alternative strategy in a more liquid and transparent form has appeal.\"\n5 types of alternative mutual funds Morningstar classifies liquid alternative funds into five main categories: long-short equity, market neutral, managed futures, multi-alternative and nontraditional bond funds. Long-short equity funds offer an exposure to both long and short stock positions. Most investors take long positions, expecting their holdings to rise in value. Short positions enable investors to make money when stocks decline. The idea of combining strategies is to limit your losses when stocks drop. Of course, that means your gains will be limited when the market rises. \"The funds usually capture some of the market's upside, but less of the downside,\" Charlson says. \"On average, they move up and down half as much as the market.\" In market neutral funds, managers seek to hedge out all of the systemic market exposure. So if it's a stock fund, your return shouldn't be affected by whether the market as a whole rises or falls. An example would be a merger arbitrage fund, in which a manager might go long stocks of potential takeover targets and short stocks of potential acquirers. The funds tend to have low, single-digit steady returns, Charlson says. \"They have low correlation to stock and bond markets.\" Managed futures funds trade in a variety of asset classes using derivatives. \"It could be a mix of equity futures, currencies, commodities and fixed income,\" Charlson says. \"It's usually a quantitative model, often following three- to 12-month trends. Historically, they've had a low correlation to stocks and bonds.\" Multi-alternative funds are modeled after hedge funds of funds. They usually package multiple alternative strategies in a single fund. \"They could have long-short funds, managed futures funds, event-driven strategy funds and others that we don't even classify,\" Charlson says. They often have a defined return target, such as a certain percentage over the Libor rate, a benchmark interest rate. And they aim for lower volatility than the stock market. But, \"we've found they have a pretty high correlation to the S&P 500 index,\" Charlson says. \"That's something you want to be aware of. You're usually looking for lower correlation.\" Nontraditional bond funds generally choose between two approaches. One is an unconstrained strategy in which the manager isn't tied to a benchmark and can choose any bond in any market. Then there are credit-based long-short funds. Managers choose their positions by focusing on the fundamentals of individual bonds. Diversification and performance What are the benefits of investing in liquid alternative mutual funds?"}
{"title": "Car Insurance Early Shopping Discounts", "text": "Early shopping discounts\nGetting an early start on things when it's time to renew your policy can put some money in your pocket. Some insurance companies, such as Travelers Insurance and Allstate, give discounts of as much as 10 percent if you switch to them before your next premium is due. To take advantage of these car insurance early shopping discounts, you should start looking at least two weeks before your current policy is up.\nBut before you jump, there's one more call you should make. Ask your current provider if it will match the competitor's early switcher discount with a renewal discount. Chances are if you're a good customer with a stellar driving record, the insurer will match the deal in order to keep you, says Knight.\nSome car insurance providers do reward loyalty. For example, in California, State Farm offers a discount if your car has been insured with the company for at least a year. The potential savings increase each year for up to six years."}

{"title": "Definition of Supplemental Insurance", "text": "Whereas primary insurance may meet your fundamental medical insurance requirements, supplemental insurance provides added protection for certain medical events.\n\nTypes of Supplemental Insurance\n\nSupplemental benefits plans provide additional protection to that offered by primary insurance for health and other life events. For instance, hospital indemnity insurance pays a fixed cash benefit for specific services, such as outpatient services or an emergency hospital stay.\n\nSupplemental health insurance might also pay for extra costs incurred due to a medical event, such as deductibles or co-insurance amounts, fees for a private room or nurse, or transportation to and from your medical service provider, as well as lodging and meals. Other supplemental plans pay for teeth cleanings, eye exams and corrective lenses.\n\n\n\nSupplemental Coverage Exclusions\n\nAccording to AARP, supplemental coverage differs from comprehensive coverage in that it will not cover the majority of medical costs a patient may incur. Additionally, a particular supplemental insurance policy may pay only for specific illnesses or medical procedures. Consequently, it's important to read a policy to understand in what circumstances a policy holder will receive a benefit and the dollar amount of the benefit."}
{"title": "The Best Time of Year to Buy a Mattress", "text": "Do you need to replace your mattress and wonder if there is a better time of the year to buy one? It's worth considering since it's rare to have a mattress-breakdown emergency. Instead, you start thinking you might sleep better on a new mattress, especially if yours is years beyond its warranty. Usually, you consider it because you are moving or adding a bed to your household. If you check the ads, you see that mattresses are constantly on sale, so you don't have to look hard to find what purports to be a deal. Just remember: mattress prices are negotiable. Ask for a better deal, and you're likely to get it. That said, there really is a better time to find real deals on mattresses.Best Month to Buy a New MattressMay is the best month to buy a new mattress at a mattress showroom. The industry rolls out its new models in June through September, so they want to clear out the older models in May. Memorial Day weekend may be the best time to get a great deal, as it combines the month of May with another peculiar sales time for mattresses - holiday weekends.The Best Weekends to Buy a New MattressRetailers tend to have good mattress deals on the long weekends of national holidays - President's Day, the Fourth of July, Labor Day. You might even snag good deals on bedding at the same time at January white sales around Martin Luther King Day weekend.Online Deals on MattressesIf you are going to shop online for a mattress, you won't be able to lie down on it and try it out. It pays to use the online sites for comparison shopping on the models you liked best in the showroom. You can use online sites to check the prices you see at retailers and get a good sense of what an actual discount price may be. Also, consider that you won't be able to negotiate a better deal as you can in a showroom, the stated price is the final price. If you find a better deal online, check the delivery details and return policy and conditions to make sure that all of the possible fees add up for real savings.Buying a Used MattressUnlike used appliances, buying a used mattress isn't often the best idea. You'll see mattresses included in many lists of things never to buy used. The big reason is bed bugs, which seem to be more and more common. You don't want them in your home, period. The second reason is that mattresses don't last forever. If you need a cheap substitute rather than a new mattress, consider a foam pad or air pillow mattress until you can afford a new one.Do Your Research and Prepare to HaggleIf you don't have an emergency need for a mattress, spend the time to determine what kind of mattress you want and how much you are prepared to spend. If you are buying at a retailer or showroom, negotiating is expected, and you will save by offering less than the sticker price. You won't have this option at a warehouse or membership store or online, so consider that when comparing prices."}

In the same survey by CareerBuilder, about 33% of employers surveyed said they would offer a flexible schedule, while 19% said they would give more vacation time and 15% would let the employee telecommute at least once per week.\nStep 2: Be grateful, but take your time.\n\u201cWhen a student receives an offer, it\u2019s really important to say thank you,\u201d says Lynne Sarikas, director of the MBA Career Center at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cBefore you start to try negotiating anything, you want to thank the employer for the opportunity (and) let them know you\u2019re interested and excited and ask for some time to make a decision.\u201d\nDuring this period, you can weigh the pros and cons of the benefits that are available, as well as the base salary.\nStep 3: Prioritize your perks.\nTo figure out your negotiating strategy, decide which additional perks would mean the most to you. For instance, if you\u2019re right out of college, you might not need childcare options, but you might want to ask about tuition reimbursement for continuing education. Or, if you know you\u2019re planning to get married or have travel plans coming up, additional vacation time might be more beneficial. You can also consider other perks such as a more impressive title.\nDon\u2019t try to nickel and dime every perk or benefit. Remember that when you negotiate, you\u2019re only making requests. If you don\u2019t ask, you won\u2019t get anything, but not every offer needs to be negotiated.\n\u201cUnnecessary negotiation can negatively impact your future at the company,\u201d says Jennifer Dillenger, director of career services at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina.\nStep 4: Ask.\nWhen you\u2019re meeting with your potential employers, have a clear sense of your priorities and lay them on the table with confidence.\n\u201cWhen you are in the moment, I often advise them to negotiate on behalf of somebody else, not just yourself,\u201d says Cathy Tinsley, a professor of management at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. \u201cEspecially for women who often undervalue themselves. If you imagine it\u2019s for someone else, you would be polite and professional, but you would be firm.\u201d\nStep 5: Get your deal in writing.\nOnce you\u2019ve come to an agreement, cement the deal. \u201cA new college grad may not realize the importance of getting it in writing,\u201d says Diane Domeyer, executive director of the Creative Group, a creative staffing agency with locations in markets throughout the United States and Canada. \u201cWhile you\u2019re negotiating terms and they say, \u2018yes we can do that,\u2019 sometimes if you don\u2019t get it in writing, memories can be short.\u201d\nStep 6: Plan your exit strategy.\nOnce you start negotiating, the goal is to exit the meeting with an agreement both sides can be comfortable with. So, more than anything, you need to remain tactful in your approach to the situation.\n\u201cDo remember this negotiation is part of the first impression \u2014 don\u2019t make them regret offering you the job!\u201d says Mary Raymond, director of the Career Development office at Pomona College in Claremont, California.\nIn the end, you might have to accept that your future employer may not be willing to negotiate. Thirty-eight percent of employers surveyed by CareerBuilder said they would not be able to provide any alternative benefits, even if a candidate\u2019s salary requirements couldn\u2019t be reached.\nBefore you go into negotiations, decide whether you would still take the job if the employer were unwilling to compromise. If you reject their offer, remain respectful and grateful for the opportunity. Thank them for the offer and their time, then briefly explain why the terms of the job would not work for you at this time. Don\u2019t forget, you never want to burn the bridge behind you.\nAnna Helhoski is a staff writer covering personal finance for NerdWallet.

{"title": "Working life goes on for serial retirees", "text": "The boomers are caught in a confluence of factors driving the re-creation of retirement: the disappearance of lifetime employment, the weakening of the retirement social safety net, skyrocketing health costs and increasing life spans. What all this adds up to is the death of traditional retirement.\nIf you retire at age 65, the traditional retirement age, you're likely to live for 15 to 20 more years, depending on your gender and health. Many will live longer. By working longer -- either in your career of choice or at some other job -- you can make important strides toward financial self-sufficiency in retirement because you're delaying drawing on the funds you've saved for retirement. Also, those funds have a chance to compound over a longer time.\n\"With the boomers, we've got 78 million people who have to think about what they are going to do in the next phase of their lives,\" says Brian Drum, chief executive officer of Drum Associates, an executive search firm in New York City. \"They are going to have to focus on what skills they have that are transferable to another job -- many will need to continue to work to fund their retirement. At the same time, there is a coming shortage of trained people in the work force, so employers are going to have to think about what they can offer older workers to keep their skills.\"\nEmployment and retirement\nFormerly, retirement was seen as a three-legged stool: a company pension, your savings and Social Security. The analogy is still valid, but the legs are different: your savings, your employment income and Social Security. The good news is that coupled with a disciplined savings plan, working in retirement for five to seven years or longer can substantially increase the likelihood that your money will outlive you instead of the other way around.\nadvertisement\nThe bad news is that if you haven't already saved much, working part-time for even five to seven years in retirement won't help that much. You'll need to work full-time for as long you can and probably lower your post-retirement standard of living so you won't outlive your savings.\n\u00ab\nBankrate wants to hear from you and encourages thoughtful and constructive comments.

Most buyers know this and view colorful descriptions with a healthy skepticism.\n\u201cThese days, with the greater demands on the market, we probably are seeing more strangeness and stretching the truth.\u201d\nHowever, the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble and the nation\u2019s subsequent slide into recession have inspired blarney that stretches the limits of credulity, Boyd says.\n\u201cThese days, with the greater demands on the market, we probably are seeing more strangeness and stretching the truth,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating for buyers when the expectation and the reality are two totally different things.\u201d\nFlat-out false\nYes, Realtors are desperate to sell homes in a stagnant market with mounting inventories. But descriptions of houses these days can be flat-out inaccurate.\n\u201cWe routinely run into transactions now where the listing agent hasn\u2019t physically been in the house,\u201d Boyd says.\nThis is especially true in short sales and foreclosures, he says.\n\u201cOn foreclosures, the bank that\u2019s in another state will often pick a low-bid real estate company that is in a different community than the house is,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cThe bank hires a property management company to put a lock box on it and the real estate company writes up their description based on whoever they sent to take a few photos of it.\u201d\nBecause most agents represent buyers and sellers, they know how to write \u2014 and how to translate \u2014 the code words.\n\u201cWe buy with our feelings,\u201d says Jay Izso, a real estate behavioral psychology specialist. \u201cThese words and phrases are designed to get you in the door, but not much more.\u201d\nIzso says the flattering phrases serve another purpose close to the listing agent\u2019s heart: pleasing the seller.\n\u201cIf I accurately call a guy\u2019s house a dump, how long do you think I would have that listing?\u201d he says.\nHomebuyer\u2019s translator\nBoyd, a past president of the National Association of Exclusive Buyer Agents, or NAEBA, was so amused by these codified euphemisms that he compiled a translation guide with the help of NAEBA members nationwide.\nFor example, he cites the commonly used term \u201ccozy\u201d and says the connotation to savvy Realtors is that there isn\u2019t much space in the house.\n\u201cIt triggers the Henny Youngman in us: \u2018This house is so small that you have to go outside to change your mind,'\u201d Boyd says.\nBoyd says that although some of these phrases can be taken to extremes, a little hyperbole is not necessarily a bad thing for buyers.\n\u201cI would rather take the time to show a buyer an extra five houses that they don\u2019t want because it\u2019s too cozy or smells bad or whatever so that the buyer has a better reference on what they are getting and the compromises to make on the house they do choose,\u201d he says.\nThe industry acronyms he\u2019s more worried about these days are \u201cBATVAI\u201d and \u201cIDRBNG,\u201d which stand for \u201cbuyer\u2019s agent to verify all information\u201d and \u201cinformation deemed reliable but not guaranteed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more of those listings now,\u201d says Boyd. \u201cThe idea is that the listing office doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for actually measuring the property or adequately describing it.\n\u201cSometimes, they don\u2019t even visit the property. They just put down the information from the assessor\u2019s records and put it on the market and say it\u2019s the buyer\u2019s agent\u2019s problem to verify it.\u201d\nNew era\nIzso says the Internet and the explosion of mobile devices like smart cell phones largely have made listing comments irrelevant.\nThe National Association of Realtors\u2019 2008 Home Buyer and Seller Survey found that 87 percent of homebuyers use the Internet to search for homes. Nearly as many buyers (32 percent) first learn of a listing online as from their real estate agent (34 percent).\nNow that buyers can easily view the condition of the roof, siding, lawns and surrounding neighborhood from overhead or street level on Google Earth and many MLS Web sites, what\u2019s the point of obfuscation?\n\u201cToday\u2019s buyer wants the facts, not the fluff,\u201d Izso says. \u201cWhen they pull up in front of a listing, they\u2019re on their iPhone to retrieve the hard data from the MLS.\n\u201cBack when buyers shopped through the classifieds or real estate magazines, the sales pitch was the first thing they read. Now it\u2019s the last thing they read, if they read it at all.\u201d\nLost in translation Jon Boyd, past president of the National Association of Exclusive Buyer Agents, joined forces with NAEBA members worldwide to compile a translation guide of listing agent euphemisms. They include: Grandma\u2019s house: Realtors interpret this to mean a) the house hasn\u2019t been updated since Grandma moved in or b) it still smells like Grandma.\nRealtors interpret this to mean a) the house hasn\u2019t been updated since Grandma moved in or b) it still smells like Grandma.

{"title": "Websites to Look for Online Job Listings in Forensic Science", "text": "You've earned a degree in one of the natural sciences with a minor in criminology, or maybe you've received a certificate in forensic science or crime scene investigation from a local community college. You're ready to go to work, but you have no idea where to look for a job in forensic science. Now what?If anyone told you that a forensic science career was a sure thing, they lied. While the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics expects there to be better-than-average job growth in the area of forensics and crime scene investigation, popular television shows such as CSI have fostered an increased interest in the field. Some fear the increased interest in crime scene investigation is flooding the job market with candidates, making it harder to find jobs.Read more about other consequences of the CSI Effect Finding a job in forensic science can be hard, but it's not impossible. Jobs are out there. You just to know where to look. You also have to be flexible. Understand that there is a possibility that you may have to move to get the job you want or need. Rest assured, though, that with patience and diligence, you'll be able to find a rewarding career.Top Forensic Science Job SitesTo help get your feet on the ground and get started on your career search, here are a few of the best sites for finding forensic science and crime scene investigation jobs: American Academy of Forensic Science: The American Academy of Forensic Science is made up of people who work within all facets of the forensics discipline, including forensic psychologists, criminalists and criminologists, professors, and forensic science technicians. Most useful for those looking for careers in forensic science, though, is the academy's online job listings, featuring employment opportunities all over the United States. Crime Scene Investigator Network: The crime scene investigator network website maintains an active list of jobs in crime scene investigation across the country. Simply go to the employment section to see all of the employment opportunities available. There is also a forum to ask questions of people who are actively working in the field. International Association for Identification: Founded in 1915, the International Association for Identification claims to be the oldest forensic science association in the world. The association's website contains helpful information on training, history and current trends. Most importantly, though, it contains a page dedicated to job listings in forensics. The listings aren't as numerous as some other sites, but the opportunities are up to date. Forensic Magazine: Forensic Magazine is an online and printed media publication that explores trends and technology in the field of forensic science. While its primary focus is on technology, product reviews and recommendations, the magazine has a section for job listings. You can even sort job listings by specialty, such as forensic engineering or linguistics. Pay close attention to the start and end date on the job postings. The site is kept up to date and postings are continuously added, but some of the ads are older and may have closed by the time you see them. The American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors: As the name implies, the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors was formed to keep managers and administrators apprised of trends within forensics and criminal justice. Fortunately for job seekers, though, the society also features employment opportunities. The jobs listed are a mixed bag of specialized, entry level and management positions. It may be an especially useful site for those looking to advance their career or move up the chain. Indeed.com: An old standby in job search sites, Indeed.com features a comprehensive job search that allows users to find careers by location, job type, salary, or all of the above. Using a keyword search, Indeed.com allows job seekers to find exactly what they're looking for. A quick search for forensics can yield more than 2,000 possibilities. Career Builder: Very much like Indeed, Career Builder offers keyword searches and advanced search features that allow people looking for jobs to search by salary or location. Many local newspapers partner with Career Builder for their onine job classifieds, making Career Builder a good place to start a search for forensic science jobs in your area.Important Considerations When Looking for Forensic Science Careers It's important to remember that online job sites are not the be all, end all of job searching. They're a great starting point to get a feel for what's out there, but they should not be the only tool on your duty belt. Remember to apply the keys to job search success: networking, cold calling, informational interviews and perseverance.When using online job boards, don't forget to look closely at opening and closing dates; some job advertisements tend to hang around on the Internet long after they've been filled. Also, take the time to tweak your resume to make sure your qualifications match the job you're going for.With the right combination of diligence and patience, all of your hard work will soon pay off, leading you to a fun and rewarding career in crime scene investigation. Stay focused on the job search and you'll be working in forensic science in no time."}
{"title": "2 Extra Years in College Could Cost Nearly $300,000", "text": "Taking six years to get a four-year college degree can cost students up to almost $300,000 in tuition, interest on loans, and forgone income and retirement savings, according to a new study from NerdWallet.\nOnly 40% of college students receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in four years, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Within six years, 60% of bachelor\u2019s degree seekers will receive a diploma.\nThose who take out student loans will have a much bigger college debt to pay off if they need more than four years to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. In addition, taking one or two \u201cvictory laps,\u201d as some students jokingly call extra years, can stunt lifelong retirement savings. NerdWallet\u2019s research shows that students who take six years to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree could miss out on more than $150,000 in retirement savings compounded over 45 years.\nTuition and loan costs\nTo find out just how much an extended bachelor\u2019s degree is costing students, we looked at a student cohort that began college in 2008 and was set to graduate in 2012 but instead finished in five years or six years, using data provided by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.\nWe started with the average out-of-pocket tuition costs at public and not-for-profit private colleges, as well as the costs of student loans to be paid back at an annual interest rate of 4.9% over the standard 10-year repayment period, to determine the total cost of taking one and two additional years to graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree. All amounts are adjusted for inflation to reflect 2016 values.\nHere\u2019s what we found:\nTuition and loan costs One\nextra year,\npublic college One\nextra year,\nprivate college Two extra years,\npublic college Two extra years,\nprivate college Portion of tuition paid out of pocket $12,557 $18,992 $25,375 $38,115 Cost of a loan, with interest, over 10 years $6,040 $7,823 $12,080 $15,645 Total cost $18,598 $26,815 $37,456 $53,760\nAlready have student loan debt? Pay it off faster.\nLearn more\nOpportunity costs\nWe also factored in the opportunity costs of forgone entry-level income and compounded retirement savings. We did not include additional out-of-pocket costs such as rent, household expenses or personal bills. Here\u2019s what we found:\nLost income\nWe looked at the average starting salary for the class of 2013, using data from the NACE and adjusted for inflation. We found a student would miss out on $46,355 in income by taking five years to graduate. A student who took six years to graduate would forgo $94,353, assuming wage growth of 4% in the second year of employment.\nReduced retirement savings\nForgone income may be a loss, but retirement savings get hit even harder. We assumed graduates would direct 7.1% of their income into a retirement plan, the average contribution rate for people under 25, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We then compounded those savings over 45 years based on a standard 7% annual return to determine the lifetime savings a student would forgo.\nWe found that students who graduate in five years would miss out on $82,074 in lifetime retirement savings, and six-year graduates would fail to gain up to $150,882.\n\u00bb MORE: How much will you need for retirement?

These include:\nLosing credits by transferring: More than one-third of undergraduate students will transfer at least once within six years, according to a 2015 study by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. During this transition, students lose about 13 credits on average, equaling approximately one semester, according to a 2014 report by the National Center for Education Statistics. For 39% of transfer students, no credits will carry over from one institution to the next.\nEnrolling in unnecessary courses: Students may take too many courses that are outside their major and don\u2019t count toward graduation. On average, graduates accumulate 134 credits when only 120 credits are required for most bachelor\u2019s degrees, according to a 2014 report by Complete College America, a nonprofit group in Indianapolis that aims to increase the number of Americans with degrees.\nTaking too few credits per semester: Nearly three-quarters of college students are not enrolled in schedules that lead to on-time graduation, according to a 2013 policy brief commissioned by Complete College America. Only 50% of students at four-year institutions are taking the 15 or more credit hours per semester that they would need to graduate on time, according to Complete College America.\nIncome disparities and graduation rates\nThere\u2019s a gap in completion rates between low-income students and their higher-income counterparts. Only 14% of students of low socioeconomic status received a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree within eight years of high school graduation, compared with 29% of middle socioeconomic status students and 60% of high socioeconomic status students, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. Socioeconomic status, as determined by the government, is based on a mix of factors including individual or family income, educational attainment and occupation.\nThe lower completion rates for students of low socioeconomic status reflect additional financial challenges the group faces in getting an education. Students who must work while attending school may have difficulty keeping up with the course load they need to graduate on time, experts say. Approximately 40% of undergraduates work at least 30 hours a week, according to a 2015 study from Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\nTo promote higher rates of on-time four-year graduation, colleges must do more for students with financial need who have to work part time or full time while attending classes, says Lisa Suzuki, director of Counseling@NYU, an online master\u2019s degree program for counseling and guidance at New York University, and an associate professor of applied psychology at NYU Steinhardt.\n\u201cCollege, for many, is an expensive endeavor, so many students have to work full time, but when they work full time they aren\u2019t necessarily going to be able to go to school full time,\u201d Suzuki says. \u201cThey still need to get financial aid, and they don\u2019t get as much if they go [to school] part time. It becomes a cyclical problem.\u201d\nColleges can support struggling students by increasing financial help for part-time study, offering courses on weekends and evenings so students can work full time, and offering a wider selection of online courses, she adds.\nHow colleges, policymakers are responding\nSchools with the best graduation rates tend to promote individual attention, a strong advising approach and a curriculum that encourages four-year completion, and they outline the availability of financial aid for all four years.\nSome colleges and universities are creating initiatives to promote 15-credit enrollment per semester to ensure students graduate in four years. Portland State University in Portland, Oregon, for example, guarantees four-year completion for all students who agree to take 15 credits per term of required degree courses, or the student won\u2019t have to pay tuition for any remaining courses needed to graduate.\nFlat tuition rates are offered at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma; Metropolitan State University of Denver in Colorado; and the entire Montana University System. With flat rates, all full-time students \u2014 those who take at least 12 credit hours per semester \u2014 pay the same tuition. This allows students to take the 15 credits per semester they need to graduate in four years without incurring additional costs. Many schools charge per credit hour, which means students who take 15 credit hours pay more than those who take only 12.\nSome schools with lower four-year completion rates are working to hire or expand advisement departments. On average, just one advisor is available to every 400 students at colleges nationwide, according to Complete College America. At schools with lower four-year completion rates, more advisors are critical to increasing on-time graduation, experts say.\n\u201cMany places have advisor-to-student ratios of 1 to 1,000 or 1 to 500, and that kind of ratio doesn\u2019t do anybody much good,\u201d says Richard D. Sluder, vice provost for student success at Middle Tennessee State in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.\nMiddle Tennessee State is working to raise its four-year completion rate of 20% with its Student Success Advantage program, which includes hiring 47 new academic advisors to bring the ratio of advisors to students to 1:240.\nThe university expanded eligibility for scholarships, added new advising software and provided incentives for students for taking at least 15 credit hours per semester. Students who have 105 hours completed by the end of their seventh semester will be on track to finish in four years and will receive a scholarship amount equivalent to the tuition increases since their freshman year. Once the new system was in place, the percentage of freshman taking 15 credit hours went from 73% in 2014 to 80% in 2015.\nAt schools with the highest four-year completion rates, six-year schooling is a rarity. \u201cEveryone gets out in four years, and I think it\u2019s largely because the curriculum is set up for that,\u201d says Travis Brown, director of the Quantitative Skills Center at Pomona College in Claremont, California. \u201cThe expectation is that you have four years to make this work.\u201d\nAt Pomona, a highly selective liberal arts college, the four-year completion rate is 90% among its 1,650 students. One reason for Pomona\u2019s high completion rates, Brown says, is its financing structure. The college has a generous need-based financial aid program that awards more than $30 million each year to meet what it says is \u201c100%\u201d of each student\u2019s demonstrated need."}
{"title": "Credit Cards - Compare Best Card Offers & Apply Online", "text": "The \"very first question\" the consumer should ask is, \"Why am I applying for this card? Why do I need this card?\" says Bruce McClary, media director for ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions, a nonprofit affiliated with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling Some positive reasons: The card has low or no fees, a lower interest rate or offers a rewards program that suits your spending habits. \"It has to make sense, and it has to fit into your overall lifestyle,\" McClary says. Do you pay off your credit card balances every month? If so, \"you don't care what the interest rate is because you won't pay any,\" says Ric Edelman, author of \"The Truth About Money.\" \"But you care about the (annual) fee,\" he says. If you run a balance, you want the lowest rate you can get, even if that comes with an annual fee.\nOne clue to your usage: \"Look at your past history,\" says Edelman. \"Because what you've done before is what you will be doing.\"\nIf you're shopping for a card, chances are you're comparing card terms. But if an issuer sends you an offer, it's tempting to apply and see what you get. \"It's really difficult to pick one (in isolation),\" says Kelly Rogers, chief development officer for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Orange County and adjunct faculty at Chapman University. \"If someone just shows you one car, how do you know if it's the right car for you?\" Her advice: Do a side-by-side comparison of several different cards before you apply. Don't be afraid to plug the card name, \"complaints\" and \"customer service\" into your favorite search engine. \"I go through and see who has the least amount of complaints and issues,\" says Rogers.\nSome cards will give you a range of rates you could get, but often that window is pretty wide, says Nick Bourke, director of the Safe Credit Card Project at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Other cards may offer a specific rate (or terms) and either approve or reject you. If you're operating totally in the dark, you have another option: Apply by phone and push for an answer on your rate and credit line before the account is opened. While there are no guarantees, sometimes you can get an answer, says Bourke.\n\"I've actually done this myself,\" he says, admitting \"you do have to go pretty far in the process.\"\nYou may have to ask for the department that's actually evaluating your application to get an answer, he says. \"The thing that you want to do is when you're talking to the person on the phone taking your application is you want to push them as hard as you can to get your APR and credit line,\" Bourke says. Then, once you have the information and before the account is opened in your name, \"you can say yes or no at that point,\" he says.\nAccording to the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, if a card offers a lower interest rate during an introductory period, the promotional rate has to last at least six months. While that introductory offer may be appealing, the regular rate is what you're really buying. So find out when the introductory APR expires and what the new rate will be. You can find this information online in the terms and conditions for the card or you can ask a service representative. Another smart question: How long is that grace period? \"Some cards start charging interest immediately,\" says Edelman. A card can have different grace periods for balance transfers and cash advances than it does for purchases. You can find information about the grace period in the credit card offer, thanks to federal rules that took effect in 2010. Look for a summary table of rate and fee disclosures, which will include a statement that explains how to avoid paying interest."}
{"title": "Get the Basics on Employee Assistance Programs", "text": "In a 'perfect' world, employees could separate their personal experiences from their professional lives. But, the reality is that many workers spend their days worried over untold personal matters which can reduce their effectiveness and put a strain on productivity levels. Fortunately, organizational leaders understand the human side of the workplace and this has led to the development of Employee Assistance Programs or EAPs, which provide support and resources for struggling employees and their spouses.What is an EAP?An Employee Assistance Program is a unique employee benefit in that it\u2019s generally offered at no cost to employees. Essentially, an EAP is designed as an intervention program that serves to identify and help employees with resolving any number of personal, financial, emotional, marital, or substance abuse issues that they may be faced with. These are problems that generally interfere with the employee\u2019s ability to perform his or her work up to company standards, or may be putting the employee and the company at risk.For example, an employee may present with a drug problem, and during a routine alcohol and drug test may test positive for an illegal substance. The option to participate in the EAP may be offered, and by doing so, the company can protect itself legally and provide an option for the employee to retain employment while undergoing treatment and counseling for this problem.How Can EAPs be Used?Employee Assistance Programs can also be utilized by employees who are under a great deal of emotional stress due to marital or family relationship discord. They may be dealing with domestic violence, have an out-of-control child at home, be facing overwhelming student loan debt, or just need to talk with a caring counselor about a personal problem. In many cases, the spouse or partner of the employee can obtain support from the EAP as well \u2013 to help sort things out so that the employee can experience a more positive work and personal life. Some EAPs also include access to free and low cost legal aid and referrals to attorneys who work with people in the community.EAP is Not Health InsuranceIt\u2019s important to note that Employee Assistance Programs are not actual health insurance plans, nor do they provide financial support to employees. However, many EAPs offer nurse advice via toll free hotlines for making important health decisions, or for getting information about mental health counseling or health services. Some programs may also be able to facilitate access to specialized care, such as for elder care services, respite care support, and even free medical clinics.How are EAPs Administered?EAPs are 100 percent paid for by employers and are most often operated through an agreement with a third-party administrator. This is critical because employees must feel comfortable speaking in confidence with a professional about their personal problems, without fear of losing their jobs or status at work. However, if the EAP offers access to medically-related support, such as mental health counseling or treatment for alcoholism/substance abuse, they are regulated by ERISA and subject to COBRA guidelines. As per the US Department of Labor and ACA guidelines, EAP programs, \"are considered to be excepted benefits, but only if the program does not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment.\" EAPs are not portable benefits, and they expire upon termination from the company benefits program.What EAPs are For The overall purpose of any Employee Assistance Program is to ensure that employees are able to manage their daily lives and remain productive, even when faced with difficult life experiences. All employees should be advised about the EAP program and given instructions about how to access these benefits at no cost to them when they need support. Managers can and should refer employees to the EAP if they are unable to resolve the matter through on-the-job coaching and HR support. While the company may know that an employee has participated in the EAP, the employee\u2019s information is private and never disclosed to the employer.EAP programs are part of a competitive benefits package and they can be highly beneficial in the workplace because they promote employee self-managed care, which can reduce health care costs for emergency room visits and expensive treatments for addictions and negative behaviors that go on too long. Employees are encouraged to take advantage of this no-cost benefit which is available any time of the year."}

{"title": "Poor Credit History? There Are Ways to Recover", "text": "In an ideal world, everyone could afford to pay cash for all items. Until that day arrives, establishing and maintaining good credit is important, because often we need credit to purchase high-priced items such as houses, cars and furniture.\nMaybe you had some tough times in the past and now you\u2019re paying the price for a poor credit history. The good news is that there are things you can do to rebuild your credit, even if you can\u2019t get a loan or conventional credit card.\nHow a credit score works\nCredit scores are three-digit numbers, typically ranging from 300 to 850, that creditors use to rate your creditworthiness. Scores are based on how responsibly you\u2019ve paid off loans in the past. The higher your score, the more likely you will obtain a loan with good terms, because you\u2019ve proven there\u2019s less risk that you will default.\nThere are three major credit scoring bureaus: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. Each agency uses different algorithms to calculate credit scores, so each bureau\u2019s score may differ.\nHow to repair your credit\nOne good option is to get a secured credit card, which requires that you make a refundable deposit into an account as collateral. Usually your credit limit will be identical to how much you deposited. Although this is not ideal, it does allow you to open a credit account despite a poor credit history and, more importantly, rebuild your credit.\nIdeally you would pay the full balance off each month, though that\u2019s not required. You must do two things if you want to rebuild your credit, though: Remit the required payment on time each month, and maintain a balance of no more than 30% of your credit limit. This balance-to-limit ratio is known as the utilization rate.\nTo illustrate the utilization rate, let\u2019s say you have a secured credit card with a limit of $1,000, because you have deposited $1,000 into the account. To keep the utilization rate below 30%, your balance should not exceed $300.\nAs you repeatedly pay the bill on time and keep your utilization rate under 30%, your credit rating should increase. Many lenders will report your account activity to the credit bureaus, which can increase your credit score. Before you apply for a secured card, check if the issuer reports to the bureaus.\n\u00bb MORE: Best secured credit cards of 2016\nThe effects of bad credit\nNot only can a subpar credit score affect your ability to get mortgages and car loans, or get good terms on those loans, it can also affect other areas of your life:\nInsurance: Insurance companies routinely check credit reports in order to determine premiums for home and auto insurance. These premiums may be higher because of your payment history.\nEmployment: Many employers perform a credit check as part of the hiring process. It\u2019s a controversial practice, but advocates say these credit checks are an important indicator of maturity, discipline and trustworthiness.\nHousing: A low score can influence a landlord\u2019s decision during the application process. Your credit report shows your monthly debts, and landlords review the report to see whether you could afford to pay rent. A bad credit score may not automatically exclude you from becoming a tenant, but delinquencies or accounts in collections may influence the decision. And if you owe money to another landlord, your chances of leasing the property are slim.\nThe road back to good credit may seem long, and you certainly won\u2019t complete it overnight, but by taking some solid steps you will begin to find your way.\nRoslyn Lash, AFC, is a financial educator and coach at Youth Smart Financial Education Services."}
{"title": "5 Steps to Launching Your Affiliate Marketing Business", "text": "On of the fastest and easiest ways to make money online is by launching an affiliate marketing business (or adding affiliate marketing to your existing business).Affiliate marketing allows you to make money online, even if you don\u2019t have blog, website, or any products of your own. Following a few simple steps can get you up and running within hours and earning your first commissions right away.The formula for affiliate marketing remains relatively constant no matter what your market or niche. Your main task will always be traffic generation (i.e. driving prospects to the merchant\u2019s website via your unique \u201caffiliate\u201d link). You can start by finding ways to drive free traffic and then adding paid advertising methods to your traffic mix.Writing good advertising sales copy (copywriting) is the other important skill for internet marketers. The good news is that when it comes to affiliate marketing, many vendors will provide you with copy to use for your blog posts, websites ads, etc.That being said, what are these essential steps for affiliate marketing success? Here, we focus on five steps to launching your own profitable affiliate marketing business.1. Choosing the Right Affiliate NetworkThe fit must be right between you and the merchant who is going to benefit from your promotional efforts, or it simply won\u2019t work. The easiest way to begin with affiliate marketing is to select an affiliate network. Many affiliate networks exist, some which are tied to well-known companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple, while others specialize in specific types of products and services.You may have heard of ClickBank, one of the oldest and most popular affiliate networks. A billion-dollar company, ClickBank specializes in digital products like e-books and software, as well as membership sites. If you are comfortable selling information and don\u2019t want the management and administration hassles of \u201creal\u201d businesses, this may be a good starting point. Its commissions can be anywhere from 10% all the way to 75%.Sometimes, individual entrepreneurs with great products are worth a look, although you should check them out first and do some research.See also: How to Make Money as an Affiliate with Information Marketing2. Research and Select the Right Affiliate ProductsA sound product strategy is a must for new affiliate marketers. Ideally, you should choose a niche that you can make money online with and has a lot of product vendors. This will give you a wide selection of products to offer your online community. However, limit yourself to two or three products at a time, so that you become the expert others turn to and trust when reaching for their wallet.As you become comfortable with the affiliate marketing process, you can consider both specialized (e.g. fly fishing) and broad (e.g. weight loss) niches. Don\u2019t forget to track your marketing metrics! They are usually provided by your merchant and/or affiliate network. This way you'll be able to know which products your audience are responding to and which ones aren't generating any profits for your business.You'll want to continually monitor the marketplace for new products, review and test promoting those products to your audience.See also: How Affiliate Marketers Can Brand Themselves to Increase Sales3. Consider Buying the Product before Promoting ItAs a new affiliate marketer, you are not obligated to purchase every product you want to promote.  However, it goes without saying that actually owning and using the products is huge for establishing credibility and trust. Intimate knowledge of the product can mean the difference between making the sale and having prospects move elsewhere.Writing product reviews are an excellent way to enhance your credibility as an affiliate marketer. This is especially easy with information products like e-books which are relatively inexpensive. After establishing some steady income it may even be worth buying higher-end products, provided you get in touch with the product creator to work out a strategic marketing plan that takes you to the next level.If you actually use the product and get results with it, then sharing a case study or your personal experience can be one of the most effective ways of selling that products to your audience.As you build a more responsive list of email subscribers and buyers and your reputation, merchants may offer you \u201cfree\u201d samples of e-books or other products.Note: in many cases merchants will be happy to offer you a free copy / sample of the product even if you don't have an established business -- it never hurts to ask!4. Utilize Social Media Marketing to Get More TrafficFacebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and other social media marketing methods are great vehicles for \u201cword of mouth\u201d or viral marketing. Video marketing in particular is a great way to demonstrate your expertise via commentary, screenshots, and live demonstrations if necessary.While at first you may be focused on using social media as a free way to get traffic, keep in mind that there are powerful ways to use paid advertising on social media to reach your targeted audience and drive that traffic back to your site or your affiliate offers.5. Consider Using Redirect / \"Pretty\" LinksCloaking or using anchor links was a controversial issue in internet marketing circles, with some affiliate marketers swearing by it and others who feel it is unnecessary.On one hand, long and ugly affiliate tracking links are a straight giveaway to people that you want to sell them a product (and people may be uncomfortable clicking on them). Therefore, making your link shorter and \"nicer\" looking will it give a more professional appearance. One of my favorite plugins for making links look \"pretty\" is the Pretty Links WordPress plugin.Click here for 3 Simple Steps to Affiliate Marketing Success."}

{"title": "Federal Reserve lets interest rates rides", "text": "A timeless bit of advice goes like this: When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. Sagely, the Federal Reserve's rate-setting body set aside its shovel. The Fed's Open Market Committee left its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent, as expected. The prime rate will remain at 4 percent, and consumer rates based on the prime rate -- those for some home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and auto loans -- will remain where they are. In a stab at clarity, the panel said explicitly that it doesn't plan to raise short-term rates for \"a considerable period.\" The intention is to keep long-term rates from rising. \"The committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future,\" the panel said in its policy statement. \"In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.\" It said the risks of inflation and stagnation are \"roughly equal,\" and added that it continues to worry about \"an unwelcome fall in inflation.\" The Fed first expressed this worry in May. The statement was more straightforward than usual. Wall Street wanted a lucid explanation of the Fed's thinking this time, because investors had been confused by the central bank's statements in the past three months: In May, the Fed expressed concern over the effects of extremely low inflation. Bond traders started buying long-term Treasury notes in hopes that the Fed later would have to buy them at inflated prices. In effect, bond traders crawled out on a limb to pick a golden apple.\nIn June, the Fed cut the federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percentage point, when much of Wall Street had expected a half-point cut. It was as if the Fed had taken a halfhearted attempt to saw off the limb.\nIn July, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that he didn't expect to have to fight deflation by using the guerrilla tactic of buying long-term Treasury notes. Picture Greenspan taking a Bunyanesque chop at the limb with a mighty ax. Down tumbled the bond traders. \"It's pretty clear that Greenspan is not that popular on Wall Street right now because of what they perceive as conflicting messages that were sent out over the last three months,\" says Bob Walters, senior vice president for Quicken Loans. The last thing the Fed wants to do, Walters says, \"is make people scurry in one direction.\" But that's what happened in May, when bond investors overreacted to the Fed's disinflation worries by driving the 10-year Treasury yield below 3.1 percent. Then bond investors overreacted in the other direction in June and July, after Greenspan's limb-cutting. They dumped fistfuls of Treasury notes on the market and drove long-term rates upward, including fixed mortgage rates. \"When all the people rush to one side of the boat, what does it do?\" Walters says. \"It tips over.\" And the hopes of many homeowners sank to a watery grave. Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose by more than a percentage point in a little over a month, strangling the refinancing craze. That can't be what Greenspan and the Fed wanted. Members of the rate-setting committee have spent the last year praising the recuperative powers of low mortgage rates. Thus today's restrained Fed meeting, in which Greenspan tried to keep the boat from listing to either side. \"I don't think he wants the market to jump around,\" Walters says. \"He definitely doesn't want long-term rates to rise. That would defeat what he's trying to accomplish\" -- spurring growth in the economy. The federal funds rate is what Fed-member banks charge one another for overnight loans. It also is known as the overnight rate. The Federal Reserve sets a target for the overnight rate and controls it indirectly by adding and subtracting cash from the banking system. The prime rate, which is what banks charge to their biggest customers, is 3 percentage points higher than the overnight rate. Long-term mortgage rates don't necessarily follow changes in the federal funds rate. Instead, mortgage rates tend to move in the same direction as yields on Treasury notes, which in turn move up and down according to investors' economic outlook. The committee's next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 16. advertisement"}
{"title": "Frugalize your utilities", "text": "Watch video\nAnchor intro: If it feels like you're throwing money out the window on your utility bills, you're most likely in need of an energy makeover. Changing your habits can cut your utility bills in half and save you hundreds of dollars annually. Here's how.\nLighting: 25-percent of a home's energy usage comes from the lighting. It takes about $9 a year to run just one CFL light bulb through the night, $21 for a conventional bulb and $35 for a big ceiling fan on high, the savings from simply turning everything off can add up quickly.\nVampire Devices: To really take a bite out of your electric bill, you should also unplug your \"vampire devices.\" Cable boxes, DVD players, TVs, microwaves, toasters and computers use up to 10 to 50 watts each while off, but not unplugged. It's estimate that vampire energy costs U.S. consumers $3-billion dollars a year. It might be inconvenient to constantly plug-in and unplug - but you can save 6 to 26% off your total electric bill annually. *\nProgrammable thermostat: Heating and cooling your home is a major expense. There are two ways to help decrease your monthly bill. First, buy a programmable thermostat, they cost as little as $25 and can save you a lot of money by allowing you set the temperature when less air conditioning or heating is required during the day when you're not at home or when you're on vacation. This can save you as much as 10% on your bill ... averaging around $180 dollars a year.\nAnother way to save on your utility bill is to set your water heater thermostat to 120 degrees. This not only avoids scalding, but it can save you between $36 and $61 annually in standby heat losses.\nReusable filters: For your heating and air conditioning to run at its most efficient, make sure you clean your air filters. Dirt and neglect can cause your unit to die an untimely death and cost you more money. Keeping them clean and reusing filters after giving them a nice vacuum and rinse saves you big bucks.\nLooking for ways to save some green on home maintenance?

{"title": "What Copyright Is Vitally Important to Authors?", "text": "Copyright legally protects an author's works \u2014 and, therefore, is vitally important to book publishing livelihoods.According to the U.S. government, \"Copyright is a form of protection grounded in the U.S. Constitution and granted by law for original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression.\"Copyright provides protection against literary piracy, which is especially critical in this time of easy digital reproduction and distribution. Protecting the copyright of your work \u2014 and defending the cause of copyright against those forces and institutions that seek to weaken the laws and protections \u2014 is imperative to anyone who wants to make a living as an author of original works.Here are some frequently asked questions from the copyright office and answers that are edited to be specific to authors and book publishing.Why is copyright important to authors?Copyright is extremely important to authors because it constitutes the ownership of one's original work. Having ownership means you can protect your work as intellectual property and control who makes money off of it \u2014 ideally you and those to whom you assign rights.Authors own the copyright to their books; the book contract controls the portions of the use of those rights and the payments made of that they bestow upon their publisher of records.What does copyright protect?Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed.Put another way, your story (or piece of music or building plans) must be fully developed, fleshed out and put down in some manner for it to be considered copyrighted. Another reason for authors to write instead of just talking about their plots!At what point is my book protected by copyright?Your book is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly (say, on paper) or with the aid of a machine or device (for example, an e-reader like a Nook or a Kindle).Therefore, Copyright covers both published and unpublished works.Do I have to register with the copyright office to be protected?In general, registration is voluntary because copyright exists from the moment the work is created - so the short answer is \"no.\" However\u2026 Registration is highly recommended for a number of reasons. Many choose to register their works because they wish to have the facts of their copyright on the public record and have a certificate of registration. You will have to register if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work to ensure you will be eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees in successful litigation. Finally, if registration occurs within 5 years of publication, it is considered prima facie evidence in a court of law \u2014 meaning, it's enough to establish that you're the owner of the work.Traditional publishers do this for the books they publish. If you are publishing the book yourself, you should check with your indie publishing service to make sure you understand who is responsible for registering your work with the copyright office.Is it true that titles cannot be copyrighted?Yes, that is true. You cannot copyright a title. Read more about creating book titles.I\u2019ve heard about a \u201cpoor man\u2019s copyright.\u201d What is it?The practice of sending a copy of your work to yourself is sometimes called a \u201cpoor man\u2019s copyright.\u201d Because the U.S. Postal Service is a federal agency, there has been a common but erroneous presumption that your stamp somehow validates your copyright. However, there is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection \u2014 again, your work is automatically protected. Mailing your work to yourself is not a substitute for the additional legal proofs that a registration provides.Is my copyright good in other countries?The United States has copyright relations with most countries throughout the world, and as a result of these agreements, we honor each other's citizens' copyrights. UNESCO's World Book and Copyright Day highlights the global value of copyright. However, the United States does not have such copyright relationships with every country."}

{"title": "Starting Into Business? Why You Need Business Checking.", "text": "I have found differences of opinion from tax professionals in the blogosphere on this subject.June Walker says you don't need a separate business checking account. In fact, she says it's easier without it.The Wandering Tax Pro Robert Flach says  you do need a business checking account.So who is right?Why You Do Need a Separate Business Checking AccountNo matter what legal structure your business has, Robert Flack quotes several tax and legal authorities who say you should have a business checking account. June Walker is talking about independent professionals who are working as sole proprietors, but even in this situation you may be tempting fate (and an IRS audit) by not keeping business and personal expenses and income separate. Using a Personal Accounting System for Both Home and Business AccountsSome online accounting software programs have the ability to track both business and personal expenses in one account. For example, Quicken allows you to track business and personal income and expenses separately from one checking account. You can categorize income and expenses as either business (and tax) related or personal (tax and non-tax) related.But it takes some setup time and concentration to make sure you keep the recordkeeping system going every month so you don't have to figure things out and separate the income and expenses at the end of the year, If you can do that, it might be possible to use the same checking account for business and personal. If Your Business Is a Sole ProprietorshipA sole proprietorship is a business entity that is not separate from the owner. If you are a sole proprietor and you combine business and personal expenses, it can be difficult for the IRS to determine if you really are in business. But that doesn't mean that the sole prop doesn't have to keep business and personal expenses separate. If a sole proprietorship chooses to keep business and personal records in one checking account, that is not a huge problem, as long as there is a record of all business expenses which are being claimed as tax deductions for the business, and as long as no personal expenses are mislabeled as business expenses.A sole proprietor can keep just one checking account as long as he or she makes certain that business and personal expenses are correctly labeled.If Your Business Is an LLC, Partnership, or CorporationFor these business entities, particularly for corporations, there is the added concern about keeping company and personal business totally separate. These business entities are, by their nature, totally separate entities for financial purposes.Failure to separate business and personal expenses by combining checking accounts can result in the owner being sued for liabilities of the business and for the owner being responsible for corporate liabilities.Don't Forget the Issue of the Hobby BusinessIn the case of a business which loses money in the start-up phase, and which could be considered a hobby (like a craft business or horse business), the separation of personal and business checking can help increase the credibility of this effort as a business, not just a hobby.Let's say you have a business selling your artwork. It might take you more than a year to sell enough artwork to be profitable. If you combine your business and personal expenses in your personal checking account, it will be difficult to pull out the business expenses. Read this IRS Article \"Business or Hobby?\" for more information....And What About the Home Based Business? If you are running your business from home, it's even more difficult - and more important - to keep your business and personal expenses separate. At tax time, you will probably want to take a deduction for your home business space. At that point, you'll need to pull in just a few of your home expenses to make that calculation. But not all of them, and not 100% of those expenses. It's far better - and easier - to take the business expenses from the business checking account and add the home expenses for the home deduction. In conclusionIf your business is a sole proprietorship, you can probably continue to keep just one checking account if you wish, but just make sure that business and personal expenses and income are labeled and that no personal expenses are claimed as business expenses.For all other types of business entities, get a separate business checking account.Disclaimer: I am not a CPA, attorney, or enrolled tax preparer.

{"title": "Tips for Writing Letters of Recommendation for Employment", "text": "For some jobs, employers request written letters of recommendation. They may even request them as part of the application process. In these cases, the applicant is asked to submit recommendation letters (typically two or three) with their resume and cover letter.Tips for Writing Letters of Recommendation for EmploymentIf you\u2019re asked to provide a reference for a specific job, the most effective letter of recommendation will be one that is written with the requirements of that particular job in mind. Refer to the job posting or job description to find specific skills and knowledge that you can include in the letter for your candidate.When you\u2019re asked to write a general recommendation letter, you can still focus on the types or category of jobs for which the person is applying.Collect Information Before You StartAsk the person for whom you are writing to supply you with a copy of the job posting and their resume or curriculum vitae (CV) before you begin composing your letter.  It can also be helpful to review their cover letter to see how they pitch their qualifications for the job.When you are writing a more general recommendation, you should still ask the subject of your letter to outline their targets for employment.  Ask them for an example or two of jobs they are applying for. Also ask them to share their most marketable assets for that type of work, especially ones you may have observed in your relationship with the person you are recommending.The more information you have about the jobs or types of jobs the candidate is applying for, the more effective your recommendation can be.What to Include in a Recommendation LetterThe first paragraph of your letter should explain how you know the person for whom you are writing.  Reference your job title and their job title when you interacted, as well as the nature of your relationship, including whether you supervised the individual.  Typically, you would also include the length of time you have known the person. Body of the LetterThe body of your letter should reference the skills, qualities, areas of knowledge and other assets of the person you are recommending.  Start by making a list of the strengths which you would like to convey in your recommendation.Then compose sentences which include references to any proof which will make your assertions about those assets more credible. Provide specific examples of instances where you observed the candidate using skills they are highlighting to the hiring manager.This might consist of a project or role where they successfully applied a certain skill.  Citing accomplishments where value was added to your organization and describing the strengths which enabled the person to generate those results can be particularly compelling.Letter ClosingIn your closing statement, it can be very effective to mention that you would hire the person again.  A positive statement about your belief that the person would be an outstanding addition to their staff can also be incorporated into your closing.Share Your Contact InformationSharing a telephone number and email address with a mention of your eagerness to share additional perspective on the candidate can also be helpful.Formatting Your LetterHere are guidelines for formatting recommendation letters including length, format, font and how to organize your letters. What Information to Include in a Recommendation Letter Sending Your LetterYou may be asked to send the letter to the person you are recommending or directly to the employer. If you\u2019re sending via email, attach a copy of your letter to the email message as a PDF or Microsoft Word document. The job posting or the employer will typically specify how the recommendation should be sent and who it should be sent to.Review Recommendation Letter SamplesNot sure what to write? Review letter of recommendation samples, including letters for employment, academic letters of recommendation and character and personal reference letters.When You Can\u2019t Write a Positive RecommendationIf you have difficulty honestly framing a compelling letter for a candidate, then it's fine to decline the request.  It's actually better to say no than it is to write a letter that doesn't strongly endorse the person you are recommending.You can simply say something vague like you don't feel totally comfortable writing a recommendation or you don't have the type of exposure that would enable you to supply the right kind of letter. Here\u2019s how to turn down a recommendation request.Read More: Letters of Recommendation | Letter of Recommendation Samples | Requesting References | Letter of Recommendation Template"}
{"title": "How to Calculate MAGI", "text": "The deductions taken on a return to determine a taxpayer's adjusted gross income don't apply to everyone. In fact, many people with relatively straightforward tax returns find that their modified adjusted gross incomes, or MAGI, and their adjusted gross incomes, or AGI, are the same. Calculating your MAGI is a matter of adding back a handful of deductions you took from your income to determine your AGI.\n\nCalculating your MAGI involves simple addition.\n\ncredit: Keith Brofsky/Photodisc/Getty Images\n\nCalculate Your AGI\n\nFirst, calculate your adjusted gross income on the first page of Form 1040. After you fill out the \"Income\" section on your 1040, you can take certain deductions in the \"Adjusted Gross Income\" section directly beneath it. These \"above-the-line\" deductions include things such as tuition and fees you paid during the tax year, individual retirement account contributions you made, alimony you paid, moving expenses and some expenses of self-employment.\n\nCalculate Your MAGI\n\nCalculating your MAGI involves adding back some of these AGI deductions. For example, your income might be $50,000 and you took two deductions in the Adjusted Gross Income section of your tax return: $12,000 for alimony you paid and $5,000 for your IRA contributions. This results in an AGI of $33,000 -- $50,000 minus $17,000 in above-the-line deductions. The Internal Revenue Service offers a calculator on its website that tells you which of these AGI deductions you must add back to figure out your MAGI. Alimony doesn't have to be added back, but IRA contributions do, so you would add back the $5,000 for your retirement contributions. Your MAGI would be $38,000 -- $5,000 more than your AGI because you had to add this particular deduction back. Your MAGI is what your adjusted gross income would have been if you hadn't taken certain deductions to calculate your AGI.\n\nWhy Your MAGI Matters\n\nYou can calculate your MAGI at tax time, but you might want to estimate it during the tax year so you can plan accordingly. Among other things, your MAGI determines whether you can deduct contributions made to your IRA. As of the 2014 tax year, the cutoff for this deduction is a MAGI of $69,000 for single taxpayers and $160,000 for married couples filing jointly. If yours is less than these limits, you can take the IRA deduction. It also affects whether you can take a deduction for tuition and education-related fees. Check with an accountant or tax attorney for the most up-to-date rules before you file your return."}
{"title": "Can I Use Preschool Tution As a Tax Write-Off?", "text": "Child care tax credits are available to taxpayers who pay for child care so that they may work or look for work. The child care tax credit was first enacted in the tax reform act of 1976. Previously, taxpayers were able to deduct a portion of the cost of child care purchased so that they could work as an itemized deduction. This reform converted the deduction to a tax credit. Congress has changed the law providing this credit in 1982, 1989 and 2003. Each of these changes were primarily made to the income levels that qualified for the credit and to the credit amount itself.\n\nChild care tax credits can save some money and offset the cost of childcare\n\nWorking Parents\n\nTo claim child care expenses toward the child care tax credit, the taxpayer must pay for the care so that the parent, or both parents if married and filing joint tax returns, can work or look for work. They must also have earned income from a salary or from self employment. A full-time student is considered to be working. A person also does not need to work if they are physically or mentally unable to care for themselves to be eligible for the child care tax credit.\n\nRequired Filing Status\n\nTo have eligibility for the child care tax credit, a taxpayer must file their return with certain filing statuses. You can file as single, married filing jointly, head of household, or qualifying widow or widower and be eligible. You are not eligible for the child care tax credit if you are married and file separate returns.\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\nYou cannot claim a credit for expenses that you pay to your spouse. You also cannot pay expenses to someone claimed as a dependent on your income tax return, nor can they be your child under the age of 19 even if that child is not your dependent. Generally, the child receiving the child care must also have lived with you for at least half of the year. Special rules may apply for the birth or the death of one of the people involved. The child receiving the care for must also be under the age of 13.\n\nCredit Amount\n\nAs of the tax year 2012, you may generally claim a base amount of $3,000 in expenses for one child, and $6,000 for two or more children. You calculate the credit from that base amount. The amount of credit allowed depends upon the income of the tax payers. With incomes of less than $15,000 per year, you may take a 35 percent tax credit. If your income is over $43,000 per year, your credit percentage drops to the smallest possible amount, or 20 percent, of the base expenses allowed. This amount is not a deduction but a credit. A credit is a direct reduction in your income taxes. A deduction reduces your taxable income only. This is not a refundable credit, which means that you only benefit if you owe income taxes for the year.\n\nPreschool and Grade School Tuition\n\nIf your child has not reached school age, or entered kindergarten, the price of any preschool tuition that you pay is eligible for the credit, as long as you meet all the other requirements for the child care tax credit. Likewise, if your child is of school age, but under 13, any before- or after-school care that you pay for that meets the guidelines is eligible for the credit. However, any expenses paid for school tuition, including kindergarten programs, are education expenses and are not eligible for a credit or tax deduction."}
{"title": "8 Tips for Great Weekend Getaways From Work", "text": "Weekend getaways are a perfect way for a busy entrepreneur to get some rest and relaxation without having a negative impact on business. If you already operate a small home business, especially one that's a one-person operation, you're probably all too aware that it's not easy to take a day off, let alone schedule an extended vacation. In fact, you may have been using some of these excuses to avoid taking time off:You might lose business to your competitors while you're away.You're just too busy to be away more than a few days at a time.There's no one to fill in for you in your absence.You're not getting paid when you're not working so a long vacation would cause a financial setback.Weekend Getaways Provide Work-Life BalanceTo balance your work life with your personal life, whether you are self-employed or not, you need to take some time off. A great alternative to a week-long vacation is to take one or more weekday or weekend getaways that might last from one to three or four days. I make it a practice to get away from my work on such excursions whenever I can. Weekday or weekend getaways help me get away just long enough to get a much needed rest without affecting my business and without breaking the bank. While I'm not always in a position to do it, I try to set up weekend getaways every six months or so.Whether you take your getaway during the week or plan weekend getaways depends on your business schedule and your preferences. Most of my clients expect me to be available during normal business hours, so I usually like to take weekend getaways.Over the years I've found that handling my time off with weekend getaways allows me to reconnect with my wife. I also get refreshed and return to work with some new ideas and a fresh outlook after these getaways.Making the Most of Your Weekend GetawaysI've discovered some ways to make the most of these weekend getaways. Here are eight tips to help you have a great getaway:Tip 1 for Great Weekend Getaways: Plan AheadIf you plan your weekday or weekend getaways ahead of time you'll get better deals on travel and lodging. You'll also be able to schedule your time in advance so you can get caught up before you leave. I know that I'm far less likely to back out of a family getaway if I already have tickets, reservations, etc. Especially if I get penalized for canceling or rescheduling.I really find it doesn't pay to be spontaneous when taking weekend getaways. As a home business owner, I can take an occasional day trip without planning, but anything more than a day or two and I'm going to want to be prepared. Otherwise, I'll constantly be worrying about what I need to do back home and if my clients are trying to reach me. By planning ahead I can prepare my clients for my brief absence, if necessary. Once you get to your getaway destination, you can be as spontaneous as you like.Tip 2 for Great Weekend Getaways: Quit a Little Early the Day BeforeIf you follow Tip 1 and plan your weekday or weekend getaways ahead of time, you should also be able to allow yourself to quit early the day before your getaway, even if it's only an hour or two. After all, this is one of the benefits of being your own boss. If you're not your own boss yet, see if the boss will let you leave a little early.Quitting early the day before your weekend getaways allows you to help your spouse or significant other pack and otherwise prepare for your trip. This gives you the opportunity to enjoy the excitement of the preparation and relieves your partner or family from having to do everything without you, which only fosters resentment and stress. Quitting early may also allow you to accomplish a task or two that you might otherwise put off until the day of your departure, which in turn only results in more stress.Tip 3 for Great Weekend Getaways: Allow For Some PamperingYou've earned your time off. You're not taking the time or incurring the expense of an extended vacation - is there some way you can treat yourself, your partner, or your family during your weekend getaway?After booking a hotel room for a recent weekend getaway I discovered the room didn't have a refrigerator just before we left on our trip. On our last few weekend getaways we've always had a refrigerator and a microwave in the room. A call to the hotel the day before we arrived allowed us to add the refrigerator for only $5 per night. When we arrived, the hotel told us that they upgraded us to a mini suite with a refrigerator at no extra charge. Sweet! And, as a business owner, I can tell you that I appreciated the gesture and will return to this hotel when I'm in the area again on a future getaway. I'll also highly recommend them to my friends and family.Tip 4 for Great Weekend Getaways: Allow Plenty of Time to Get to Your DestinationIf your travel will take most of one day, or if you have an event scheduled on the evening of your arrival, make sure you give yourself plenty of time to reach your destination without rushing. Unexpected delays can hit you from out of nowhere. I learned my lesson the hard way on one of our weekend getaways when we got lost at our destination and couldn't find the hotel - despite a fistful of maps I printed from the Web. The first night turned out to be very hectic and rushed - especially because we were in town for an annual jazz fest and the traffic was incredibly backed up due to construction in the area. Additionally, if you're retreating to a popular spot on a weekend or planning to arrive on a Friday night around rush hour, you need to give yourself even more extra time.By giving yourself a little extra time, you'll find that your weekend getaways are more enjoyable. If you're driving, you'll be less likely to have an accident on the way. If it means getting up a bit earlier on the day you leave, do it. Your mood will be much better for it. Your departure experiences can set the tone for your entire trip - don't spoil the mood before your weekend getaways even get started.Next: Weekend Getaway: Tips 5 through 8.Weekend Getaway Tip 5: Enjoy Dining OutWhile I don't take my wife out to eat as much as I'd like to when we're at home, I do like to take advantage of a weekend getaway by exploring new restaurants. Whether it's an inexpensive breakfast at a local chain or a nice quiet evening in a quality restaurant with a bottle of wine, dining out while on a weekend getaway can encourage intimacy with your partner or some quite time together with your family.You may not have noticed, but typically when you eat in a restaurant, you can be in your own little world. Unless you eat in a family style restaurant, you have your own table or booth and you're either facing each other or are side by side. This is a great opportunity to have some quality one-on-one time without the pressures of home.Weekend Getaway Tip 6: Avoid Discussing Business or WorkSure, the conversation is likely to go toward your business from time - that's pretty much unavoidable whether you work for yourself or for someone else. But don't waste your entire weekend getaway blabbing about how you want to do this, or how you should have landed that account, or how you're going to rethink your marketing and sales strategies. After all, this is not a business trip - even if you and your partner work together! This is your personal getaway. Work will still be there when you get home. You took the weekend getaway in the first place because you needed a break - now enjoy it!Weekend Getaway Tip 7: Be Flexible Once You Decide to Do ItIf you had plans or had a specific route in mind for your weekday or weekend getaway trip, be flexible enough to change them to maximize your enjoyment. After all, if you followed my other weekend getaway tips to this point, you've already planned in detail. I'm not talking so much about travel or lodging arrangements you might have made in advance to save money. But if your spouse suggests you stop at an interesting antiques store on your way to a show, or your kids want to stop to see something and you have the time, by all means do it. You're bound to discover things you hadn't planned on and you may have more fun during your weekend getaway than you expected.Whenever possible, everyone present should have at least one special request fulfilled during your weekday or weekend getaway because it goes a long way toward promoting harmony and boosts the satisfaction of all who are on the trip.Weekend Getaway Tip 8: Enjoy the Trip HomeSince I'm always the route planner and driver, I had a set way in mind of driving home from my last four-day weekend getaway. At one point I had to decide if I wanted to take the shortest route, which might put us in the middle of Boston rush hour traffic, or take the long way over the hills and through the woods of Western New Hampshire. I opted for the scenic route. When we got home from our getaway we were both much more relaxed than we would have been if we had to sit in rush hour traffic. Not only did we enjoy the scenery, the entire weekend getaway was that much more enjoyable.Once you get home from your weekday or weekend getaway, check your messages (or better yet, put them off until tomorrow if you can) and enjoy the rest of the evening. Tomorrow it's back to work. Savor the final hours of your getaway while you can."}
{"title": "Difference Between Nominal & Effective Interest Rates", "text": "Whether you're taking out a loan to purchase a new car or using a credit card to make purchases, lenders generally advise you of the nominal, or stated, interest rate you'll pay on balances. However, when repaying a loan you'll usually end up paying a higher percentage of interest than the nominal rate you're quoted -- known as the effective rate. The difference between the two is the result of the compounding periods that the effective interest rate takes into account.\n\nCompounding Is the Main Difference Between Rates\n\nCompounding periods refer to the number of times per year interest charges are calculated and added your outstanding balance. Most credit card companies, for example, compound interest on a monthly basis -- meaning they increase your outstanding balance by one-twelfth of the annual interest rate each month. In other words, if your credit card offers a 12-percent interest rate but it compounds monthly, your balance will increase by one percent each month. The 12-percent rate is the nominal rate, which gives you a monthly nominal rate of one percent.\n\nEffective Interest Rates & Capitalization\n\nWhen a loan balance is compounded monthly, you're actually paying more than 12 percent each year -- the precise amount being the effective interest rate. Effective interest rates take into account the number of compounding periods and the fact that interest is capitalized after each period.\n\nCapitalization means that the interest charges applied after each period increase the debt balance subject to interest during the next compounding interval. Put simply, interest is charged on prior interest charges if not paid off by the next compounding interval. For example, if your balance at the end of the first month is $1,000 and you're charged one percent interest, or $10, the balance used to calculate interest at the end of the second month is $1,010. In this example, the lender is charging interest on interest -- and effective interest rates reflect the true rate of interest you're paying at the end of the year because of this.\n\nCalculating Effective Interest Rates\n\nIf you know what the nominal, or stated, rate of interest is, you can figure out what your effective rate is with the following formula:\n\nEffective Interest Rate (EIR) = (1 + a / b)b \u2013 1\n\na = nominal rate of interest expressed as a decimal (i.e. enter .10 for 10%)\n\nb = number of compounding periods in one year\n\nCredit Card Example\n\nTo illustrate how this works, suppose you transfer a $10,000 balance to a new credit card that offers an introductory interest rate of 9 percent for the first year, compounded on a monthly basis. Your effective interest rate is calculated as:\n\nEIR = (1 + .09/12)12 \u2013 1\n\n= (1.0075)12 \u2013 1\n\n= 1.0938 \u2013 1\n\n= .0938 or 9.38%\n\nThe effective interest rate is 0.38 percent higher than the advertised nominal rate. If you maintain the $10,000 balance throughout the year, you'll actually pay $938 in interest -- not the $900 you'd arrive at when using just the nominal rate."}
{"title": "Wheel of Worry: 6 Risks That Can Ruin Your Retirement Plans", "text": "Similarly, if the market takes a dive right before or after withdrawals begin, your portfolio may never be able to recover.\nFor someone with a $1 million portfolio, \"If you have five bad years in the market, you might have $800,000. If you have five great years in the market, you may have $2.5 million,\" says Certified Financial Planner professional and lawyer David Littell, co-director of the New York Life Center for Retirement Income and a lawyer and professor of taxation at the American College.\nIf a market downturn hits in the first few years of retirement and withdrawals must be taken from a retirement portfolio, it can have lifetime ramifications. The retiree may even run out of money early. On the other hand, a few awesome years at the beginning of retirement can put some serious cushion under savings and increase the probability of dying with money in the bank.\nHow to prepare\nPlanners mitigate the risk by advocating guaranteed income products or by using asset allocation and spending plans that take into account worst-case scenarios. Consider these strategies to curb risk and ensure a successful retirement plan.\nDial down the risk in your portfolio\n\"We see more balanced portfolios as a way to manage the sequence risk. So technically on average I will have less money by owning a balanced portfolio, but I'm less exposed to these sequence risk issues because I just don't have as much risk on the table,\" says Certified Financial Planner professional Michael Kitces, partner and director of research at the Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Maryland, and publisher of the Kitces Report and Nerd's Eye View.\nSpend less when the market dips\n\"If you are able to tighten your belt a little and spend less in the bad years, it leaves a little bit more money invested so that you can recover. Then you can spend more in the good years,\" Kitces says.\nSpend less no matter what the market does\n\"That is the origin of what is often called the safe withdrawal rate research. I'm going to pick a number that is just conservative enough that if I get a bad sequence (of returns), I'll be OK, but there will probably not be a lot left over. If I get a good sequence, I'll just have more money than I was expecting,\" Kitces says.\nSubstitute bonds with annuities\n\"We have this new product, a deferred income annuity, that allows you to buy specified income that will begin at some future date before you get to retirement,\" says American College's Littell.\n\"At 55, I could buy income that is going to start at 65. I can reduce my risk by starting to lock into some income and have my own kind of personal pension plan by buying a specified income that starts at 65,\" he says."}

Since the late 1980s, the government has helped transform its economy an export-driven, high tech juggernaut. The result has been higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates that have averaged 3.6% over compared to the OEDC average of just 2.5%, between 1992 and 2007.The country has also proven resilient to the global economic downturn of 2008 and beyond. In fact, the country\u2019s economy and employment levels actually grew during the worst of the crisis.

While ETFs represent the easiest way to invest in a diversified portfolio, investors looking for specific opportunities may want to consider ADRs or even securities listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) or others.Some popular Australian ETFs include:MSCI Australia Index Fund ETF (EWA)Australia Dividend Fund ETF (AUSE)IQ Australia Small Cap ETF (KROO)Some popular Australian ADRs include:BHP Billiton Limited (BHP)Alumina Limited (AWC)Samson Oil & Gas Limited (SSN)Investors looking to purchase Australian securities directly can do so through the country\u2019s six major stock exchanges. Many larger investment brokerages have the ability to buy and sell Australian securities, but investors should consult their brokerage or financial advisor. And finally, it\u2019s also important to consider the tax implications of investing in foreign countries.Key Points for Investing in AustraliaAustralia has a robust economy that has avoided many of the problems seen in other developed countries over the years, due to strong commodity prices and its proximity to key Asian emerging markets.There are some risks to consider before investing in Australia, including its reliance on commodity prices and Asian demand, as well as the potential for unfavorable tax increases on its natural resources sector.Investors can invest in Australia using ETFs, ADRs, or by purchasing securities directly on one of the country\u2019s six stock exchanges. But for most investors, ETFs represent the easiest option of the three."}

{"title": "What Is Budget Reform?", "text": "Government bodies raise money by imposing taxes on citizens and then use those funds to pursue various programs such as education, defense, infrastructure and research and development. A government's budget describes all of its sources of income and where it spends that income, and budget reform is the process of making changes to how the government collects and spends money.\n\nBudget Reform Basics\n\nGovernments pursue budget reform for many reasons. If government spending is greater than the amount of money the government takes in with taxes, reform may be necessary to balance the budget and control government debt. Politicians may pursue changes in government spending or taxation to gain favor with their constituents. In the United States, budget reform occurs through the passage of bills in Congress and state government houses that affect taxes and spending.\n\nBenefits\n\nBudget reform can have many potential benefits. Reforms can reduce wasteful expenditures and help lessen government deficit, potentially leading to surpluses. A surplus occurs when a government takes in more money than it spends. Budget reform can result in funding for new beneficial programs or increases in funding education, infrastructure or other areas to help certain individuals or organizations. Tax reforms can benefit individuals and businesses if they reduce their tax burden. Cutting taxes can stimulate spending, which can help stimulate economic activity.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nBudget reform only describes changing the collection or spending of money, not whether spending or collection goes up or down. Any potential benefit to budget reform can also be a drawback if changes occur in an unfavorable direction. For instance, if the government reforms its budget by cutting spending on education and infrastructure, it could hurt students and those who rely on public infrastructure spending for their jobs. Increases in spending can make governments fall into debt.\n\nControversy\n\nGovernment spending and taxation is controversial, and any budget reform that a government pursues is likely to be viewed as beneficial by some and negatively by others. Budget reforms passed by Congress often reflect a compromise between desires of different political parties."}

{"title": "Student loans are becoming scarce", "text": "college\nIf you're counting on the federal government to pay for part of your child's college education, beware. The available money may be decreasing quickly. Congress finally came to an agreement to raise the nation's debt ceiling recently, but not without major budget cuts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 includes immediate cuts to federal student aid, and experts say additional cuts to federal student loans may be coming.\n\"Student aid is still at risk,\" says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the FinAid and Fastweb websites and author of \"Secrets to Winning a Scholarship.\" \"It's a big target, so there's a high likelihood of additional cuts.\"\nGood news and bad news\nThe Pell Grant program, which has been operating with an $18.3 billion shortfall, received a boost from the Budget Control Act, which allocated an additional $17 billion to finance the program. While the money won't expand the Pell Grant program, it will help to maintain the program at its current grant levels.\nThe bad news is the money to boost the Pell Grant program was raised by making cuts to the federal student loan program, eliminating the interest subsidy on loans to graduate students for loans after July 1, 2012, and eliminating the Education Department's Direct Loan Program repayment incentives.\nBefore the act, graduate students who received subsidized student loans could have portions of the accruing interest waived by the federal government, says Ryan Franklin, a certified public accountant for Moss Adams Wealth Advisors in Seattle. The Act's elimination of this subsidy and other smaller loan origination fee rebates was estimated to raise $21.5 billion for the federal government.\n\"The net result of these changes was a cut in education spending of around $4.5 billion,\" Franklin says.\nEliminating subsidized student loans for graduate and professional students means interest on their loans will begin to accrue while they are in school. \"The rationale is that these students have been in the work force and potentially have the ability to increase their earnings,\" says Patrick Kandianis, co-founder of SimpleTuition, a website providing information and resources about paying for college.\n\"A graduate student with the average amount of student loans ($17,500, of which $8,500 is subsidized) could now owe as much as $600 of interest per year while in school. This amount is part of the principal upon repayment at a federal rate of 6.8 percent,\" Kandianis says.\nIn addition to the elimination of federally subsidized loans for graduate and professional students, the Budget Control Act also eliminated prompt payment discounts for federal Direct Loan and PLUS Loan borrowers as of July 1, 2012. Direct loans, issued by the federal government to the student through the U.S. Education Department, previously provided borrowers with an interest rate reduction for using automatic debit repayment. PLUS Loans, unsubsidized loans to parents to help pay for their child's education, previously offered a rebate of the origination fee if borrowers made their first 12 payments on time."}
{"title": "Fix credit before wedding?", "text": "debt\nDear Debt Adviser,\nMy fiancee has delinquent credit card debt that she cannot pay and has not paid for years. The debt is due to her previous marriage and spouse, but it's in her name. If we get married, can the credit card companies come after me, my credit or bank accounts? I have good credit, and am current on all of my bills. Thanks.\n-- William Dear William,\nSurely your intended wife has other fine qualities besides the ones you have mentioned! Love is often said to be blind, so I'm glad you are asking some real life questions that will be with you after the honeymoon and long after the bloom is off the rose. I also notice that you have said \"if\" we get married, indicating this is not yet a done deal.\nHere's the scoop. Any debts that were incurred before the marriage remain the sole responsibility of the owner of the debt after the marriage. So, if you marry, your fiancee's creditors may not attempt to collect from you any of her debt that was incurred before the marriage. They cannot report any of her debt on your credit report. The question regarding your bank account is a little trickier.\nShould your new bride's creditors sue in court to collect and receive a judgment, it could be used to garnish a bank account. If you have a joint bank account with her, any money that you deposited in the account could be garnished. You would most likely get it back eventually, once you jumped through all the hoops of proving that the money they took was yours and the debts were not, but who wants to go through that? As with many second-marriage couples, especially those with independent assets (or debts), I recommend keeping separate bank and investment accounts that were accumulated before the marriage to reduce any potential problems.\nNow, I have a question for you: Have you and your fiancee discussed how you will manage your finances together once you are married? Because you know about her delinquent credit card debt, it sounds as if you have had a least a partial conversation about your financial pasts. It is also important to cover your financial future. If you haven't already, here are some things you should do as a couple financially.\nTake a look at each other's credit reports and credit scores.\nKnow each other's current annual salaries and your hopes for future income.\nDetermine who is a spender and who is a saver.\nTalk about how you plan to pay any outstanding debts.\nSpecifically discuss how her old debts will be handled. Does she expect you to pay, to help her to pay, or is there a bankruptcy lurking in your future?\nNow is the time to come clean about any past bankruptcies or other major events in your financial past.\nDiscuss spending and budgeting. If one of you doesn't know what a budget is, I suggest you get one.\nDisclose if you have co-signed a loan for anyone.\nDevelop financial goals for the next five years.\nDecide what your long-term financial goals are and how you will fund them.\nOne last thought is to find out if you live in a community property jurisdiction (Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin). If you do, you can be held responsible for any debts that your wife incurs after the marriage. Remember, if you don't learn any lessons from the past and act accordingly, you (and she) will be destined to repeat it.\nGood luck!\nAsk the adviser\nTo ask a question of the Debt Adviser, go to the \" Ask the Experts \" page and select \"Debt\" as the topic.

{"title": "How to Apply for a Debt Relief Grant", "text": "Many people who are swimming in debt may not know how to seek government assistance for debt relief. By applying for debt relief grants, you can minimize the time it takes to pay off your total debt and open up funds for you to start purchasing again. These government-backed debt relief grants don't require you to put up collateral; you just need to show you cannot pay the debt. These grants can help people pay off debts such as medical bills, student loans and business startup loans. The government offers such debt relief so that people can pay off their debt and start spending money normally again, to stimulate the economy. In order to apply for a grant, you need to make sure you know your situation clearly and have proper paperwork about your debt.\n\ncredit: Jupiterimages/Comstock/Getty Images\n\nStep\n\nLook for debt relief grants on the Internet. Go to government grant websites such as Grants.gov or USAsearch.gov and search for \"debt relief grants.\"\n\nStep\n\nOnce you find a grant that you think you can qualify for, gather and organize your financial information depending on the type of grant. For instance, if you are applying for credit card debt relief, gather your credit card statements and know the exact balances and interest rates on each card.\n\nStep\n\nApplying for a debt relief grant can be a daunting task and, oftentimes, the government offers grants to nonprofit debt companies that counsel those who are in debt. For instance, if you are a small-business owner who would like help with a small-business loan, a search on Grants.gov can provide information on loan programs that will help you pay off that debt.\n\nStep\n\nOften, applying for a grant means writing a grant proposal. This is a large part of the selection process, and could make or break your application. Make sure that you have collected all the information required before starting, and edit the proposal after you've written it to ensure there are no errors. There are online resources to help with grant proposal writing; try individual grant proposals sites such as GrantProposal.com.\n\nStep\n\nIf for some reason you do not receive a debt relief grant, don't despair\u2014there are programs that can help you get your debt down to a reasonable level. Many companies offer assistance and advice, but be very choosy. Consider how much the company charges for their services, talk to friends and family for recommendations and do research online about the company's dependability and reputation."}
{"title": "Internet Crime Victim Profile", "text": "David Jakle/Getty Images\nBack in 2009, a study found that people who received phishing emails fell for the scam about half of the time. But that doesn't mean it's easy to get an accurate reading on the overall number of Internet crime victims. Not everyone who is conned on the Internet reports it.\nThe Internet Crime Complaint Center says it received its 3 millionth complaint in 2014. Complaints lodged with the organization number about 300,000 per year. Internet crime in general ratcheted up in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Nigerian scams (also known as 419 scams) started landing in John Q. Public's inboxes. Although these early forays met with a lot of initial success, Internet users have grown savvier and don't fall as often for transparent confidence schemes like these.\nBut there are always exceptions. And Brad Klontz, professor and co-founder of the Financial Psychology Institute, says that being a nice person can cost you.\n\"Trusting, caring, generous individuals tend to be more vulnerable to scams. Individuals with limited experience are also more vulnerable. This could entail a general naivet\u00e9 regarding the darker side of humanity, or a lack of technical competence,\" says Klontz, co-author of \"Mind Over Money.\"\nProtect your identity with tools from myBankrate.\nSource: U.S. Department of Justice\nInternet crime victim profile\nBasically, the more faith a person has in his fellow man, the more vulnerable he or she is to being scammed, so being somewhat cynical does have its rewards. But the na\u00efve aren't the only ones successfully targeted by thieves. Klontz says changing technology often leaves some behind -- particularly the elderly, who are less likely to be up-to-date on changes in the cyber world. \"As such, older adults can be more vulnerable to scams that involve newer technology,\" says Klontz.\nOthers may also find themselves at risk. Klontz says categories of scam victims often include:\nYoung people who often lack enough life experience to recognize when they are being asked to do something that puts them at risk.\nIndividuals who have limited experience with crime and the criminal mindset; it may never cross their minds that requests (by criminals) are not sincere.\nThose suffering from recent stress.\nKlontz adds that everyday stress often makes individuals more vulnerable. Serious stress can hit us where we really hurt.\n\"Higher levels of stress make it more challenging to evaluate the legitimacy of a request for action,\" he says. \"I like to say that when we are emotionally charged, we are rationally challenged.\"\nKlontz says that as a result, we're more vulnerable when we're going through life-changing events, such as divorce or the death of a loved one. And since scammers also know that low points are an open door for them, they target these individuals.\nThat said, Klontz reminds us that anyone can be a victim at any time. Being tech-savvy and careful isn't enough to scam-proof yourself. \"We can all fall victim,\" he says, especially to scams that look like simple requests from companies with which we regularly do business (such as a recent con asking potential victims to update their email information).\nThe best defense against victimhood is to be suspicious of everything and everyone. It doesn't mean you won't get scammed, but at least you'll be harder to victimize."}

{"title": "The Salary of a Cemetery Sales Rep", "text": "Cemetery sales representatives help people make decisions regarding final expenses, whether for themselves or for family members. Final costs include caskets, markers, urns, crematory expenses and burial expenses. Cemetery sales representatives help families make arrangements when their loved ones have died, referred to as at-need sales, and help people plan ahead for their final expenses, referred to as pre-need sales.\n\nFuneral and burial expenses can be paid in advance.\n\ncredit: kzenon/iStock/Getty Images\n\nPay Structure\n\nPre-need sales counselors typically work out of the office running sales leads. The counselors either set their own sales leads or the company has a team of employees that set leads for them. Pre-need sales counselors work on a commissions-only based pay structure. At-need sales counselors are those who work in the office, helping families make immediate arrangements for their loved ones who have died. Typically, if the at-need sales counselor does not make a certain level of sales during the week, he is paid an hourly salary in lieu of commissions.\n\nState Laws and Wages\n\nState laws can affect a cemetery sales counselor's wages, sometimes dramatically. Some states, called noncombination states, have laws that prohibit one company from owning both a funeral home and a cemetery. Other states allow one company to own both a cemetery and funeral home; these are referred to as combination states. The wages for a cemetery sales rep in a combination state may be higher because they can sell funeral products as well as cemetery products.\n\nAverage Salary\n\nThe average annual salary for sales representatives in the funeral homes, cemeteries and crematories in the United States is $52,499, according to the Economic Research Institute Inc. Salaries ranged from $42,000 to $58,000, according to experience. This number can fluctuate widely depending on whether the state allows combination cemetery-funeral homes and the size of the market in which the cemetery or funeral home is located. Cemetery sales representatives working in larger cities tend to make a higher income than those working in smaller cities.\n\nCommissions and Bonuses\n\nCemetery sales representatives can often achieve weekly and monthly bonuses based on their sales amounts. Different products and services often come with different commissions. For example, a company may pay 15 percent commission on a pre-need sales contract, but only 5 percent commission on an at-need sales contract. These types of commission structures can also affect the average annual salary for cemetery sales reps."}
{"title": "20 ways to get federal money for college", "text": "college\nScrounging for college cash? Let Uncle Sam foot the bill. Paying for college If your college savings aren't as flush as you'd like, check out these tips to get your slice of the free money. 20 ways to get federal money Assess your assets.\nApply, no matter what.\nMeet the deadlines.\nSave in parents' names.\nDitch your debt.\nCount your babies.\nCoordinate your college students.\nServe your country.\nMaximize IRAs, 401(k)s.\nBuy a house. Spend, spend, spend.\nGet personal in financial-aid office.\nKeep up the course load.\nWork it.\nReduce capital gains.\nTest yourself.\nPerk up.\nReport the support.\nUse the grandparents.\nBe honest. 1. Assess your assets. Knowing is half the battle. FinAid.org offers free online financial aid calculators that can help you determine what sort of award your family might qualify for, how much you'll need and, most importantly, what fiscal assets could potentially reduce your aid package. Having a clearer picture of your financial prospects will help you maximize your child's aid eligibility.\n2. Apply, no matter what. According to the American Council on Education, every year, millions of students who qualify for Pell Grants miss out on the free government cash simply because they don't fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, paperwork. In fact, regardless of assets or household income, all dependent students qualify for Stafford loans. But you can only get them if you file your FAFSA.\n3. Meet the deadlines. Turning in your FAFSA late can significantly decrease your chance of banking big. Keep in mind your state's deadline, too. \"We encourage students to complete the FAFSA as early as possible and in advance of state deadlines so that they can get all of the free money that they are entitled to,\" says Martha Holler, vice president of corporate communications at Sallie Mae. Cathy Thomas, former director of financial aid for the University of Southern California, reports that missed deadlines are the No. 1 mistake students make when applying for federal aid. \"If they don't miss them the first year, they miss them the second or the third or the fourth,\" she says. To make sure your student qualifies for all first-come, first-serve aid, estimate your annual income and turn in your FAFSA as early in the year as possible.\n4. Save in parents' names. No mortgage payment, no electric bill, no insurance premium -- the life of a student is fiscally sweet. But the government does expect students to contribute financially to their own education. Dependent students are expected to apply up to 20 percent of assets toward college, while parents contribute up to 5.64 percent of their assets. Instead of stockpiling money in your child's account, keep it in your own or stick it in a 529 plan.\nBefore applying for a loan, check your credit score for free at myBankrate.\n5. Ditch your debt. While aid officers will consider what you've got, they won't consider what you owe. Consider liquidating funds that could count against you by paying off loans or credit card debt. Beyond simply increasing your child's eligibility for federal grants and scholarships, eliminating debt will also help your family qualify for larger, lower-interest loans.\n6. Count your babies. The amount Uncle Sam expects you to contribute to your child's education partly depends on your family size. Put simply, larger families are expected to contribute a smaller percentage of their income per college-bound child than smaller families. Most parents don't realize that unborn children count as family members, too. Pregnant mothers should count each expected child in the case of twins, triplets, etc., but be sure to get written confirmation from a doctor.\n7. Coordinate your college siblings. Looking to double the size of that aid package? Try doubling the number of kids you have in college. \"Financial aid formulas are very heavily weighted toward yearly income, and just because you have more children in school at the same time doesn't mean that you have more income,\" says Mark Kantrowitz, founder of financial-aid website FinAid.org. \"Holding back a child or trying to maximize the overlap between the children in school -- that can have a big financial impact.\"\n8. Serve your country. For students looking for a constructive way to spend a gap year (possibly to help coordinate the number of siblings simultaneously in school), Americorps offers yearlong service programs that are guaranteed to never lower your financial aid eligibility. Besides giving a small stipend and an educational award upon completion, the program offers invaluable training, the opportunity to make a difference and great experience to note on a college application.\n9. Maximize IRAs, 401(k)s. Two assets that won't be considered on the FAFSA form are funds invested in your family's primary home and accounts set aside for retirement. Investing more money in your future now could result in the government investing more in your child's future. If you have liquid funds just waiting to find their way into your retirement account, invest no later than two years before applying for federal aid because the prior year's contributions to a retirement plan could count as income on the FAFSA.\n10. Buy a house. If you're thinking about moving on up, consider your timing. Funds tied up in the purchase of a family's primary home are not considered available assets. Instead of having that equity subtracted from your child's aid package, use it to your mutual advantage by investing in something your entire family can enjoy."}

{"title": "How Long Can You Have a Check Before Cashing It?", "text": "Finding an old check at the bottom of your drawer doesn't necessarily mean you'll get a boost in your bank account. You generally have six months to cash or deposit a check. If you have one that was written earlier than that, a bank or credit union isn't obligated to honor the item.\n\nA teller is stamping a personal check.\n\ncredit: Keith Brofsky/Photodisc/Getty Images\n\nObeying the Rules\n\nThe Universal Commercial Code doesn't require a bank to honor a check older than six months. In addition, the Federal Reserve says a bank doesn't have to accept a check if it has reasonable doubt that the issuing bank will pay the amount. An old check creates that doubt. However, just because a bank isn't required to accept a check after six months doesn't mean it won't. Each bank makes its own policy for checks after that period.\n\nCheck the Wording\n\nSome issuers have a time limit on their checks, such as \"Void after 60 days.\" This is meant to encourage the recipient to deposit or cash the check quickly. However, the Universal Commercial Code doesn't specifically address the validity of those dates, and they can be ignored at the bank's discretion. Unless the issuer has an agreement with the bank to adhere to the shorter time span, the check will be honored for six months. However, to play it safe, ask the issuer if it's still OK to cash the check or if you can be issued a replacement."}
{"title": "What Does NR Mean on a Credit Report?", "text": "Credit reports can be difficult to interpret, in large part because of the numerous shorthand codes that appear on them. The code \"NR\" can bode good or ill for you, depending on your payment history.\n\nWhat NR Means\n\nAn NR code means that a business or lender gave the credit bureau no information about the account for that month or a period of time. This code might show up because you maintain a line of credit you don't use, such as at a store credit card, or because the credit provider never reports payment information for any customers.\n\nConsequences of NR\n\nPayment history -- good or bad -- influences your credit score. If you always pay your bills on time, but the information never makes it to the credit bureaus, it hurts your credit score because you don't get the positive impact of your good payment history. However, it works to your benefit if a creditor cuts you a break by not reporting a few late payments. Consider asking your creditors to report your payments if you make prompt, consistent payments."}

{"title": "4 Tips to Slash Unnecessary Monthly Expenses", "text": "Most of us pay our bills around the beginning of the month, and about this time the stack can get pretty high \u2014 as does the hit to your bank account. If you\u2019re like me, you often think, \u201cWhat can I do this month to cut my expenses, in a smart way, and waste less money while I\u2019m at it?\u201d\nI\u2019ve got some ways to do exactly that. Here are my four tips that you can implement today:\n1. Cut the cost of wireless service\nIf you aren\u2019t locked into a contract with one of the national carriers, consider using the services of providers that might be offering a cheaper plan. Also look at your data usage. Maybe you can simply switch to another, less expensive plan. And once it\u2019s time to upgrade, think hard \u2014 do you really need to have that latest model of the iPhone? (You may want it, but that\u2019s another story.)

Eliminate your landline\nCome on now, we live in the 21st century, and almost everyone has a cell phone. Think about how you take and make almost all of your calls these days. Then ask yourself: Do I really need to keep my landline? When I cut my landline six years ago, it saved me about $35 per month.\n3. Cut the TV cable cord\nThe cost of cable television these days runs about $80 to $100 per month if you have a premium subscription. Assess your situation: Are you really watching that much TV every day? Can you get away with a streaming service from sites such as Amazon.com, Hulu.com or Netflix?\nIt\u2019s now been eight years since I\u2019ve had cable TV, and to tell you the truth, I haven\u2019t missed a thing. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve seen a total savings in those eight years of $7,680.\n4. Slash your electric bill\nDo you have a programmable thermostat?

For current tax or legal advice, please consult with an accountant or an attorney since the information contained in this article is not to be relied on as tax or legal advice and is not a substitute for tax or legal advice.Kentucky is currently one of only six states that assess a separate inheritance tax on certain property owned by a Kentucky resident and real estate, and tangible personal property located in Kentucky that is owned by a non-resident. The other states that collect a state inheritance tax include Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.Estate Taxes vs. Inheritance Taxes - What's the Difference?While it may just seem to be semantics, there is a real difference between an estate tax and an inheritance tax:An estate tax is charged against the entire estate regardless of who the beneficiaries of the estate may be.An inheritance tax is only charged against the shares of certain beneficiaries of an estate.Which Beneficiaries Are Subject to the Kentucky Inheritance Tax?Each beneficiary of a Kentucky estate receives an exemption from the inheritance tax based on the beneficiary's degree of relationship to the decedent. Here are the exemptions from the inheritance tax that are currently available under Kentucky law: Class A - Class A beneficiaries include the deceased person's surviving spouse, parents, children (by blood or adopted), grandchildren (by blood or adopted), stepchildren and step-grandchildren (by blood or adopted), brothers and sisters (whole or half), and certain charitable organizations. Class A beneficiaries are \u200bcompletely exempt from paying the Kentucky inheritance tax. Class B - Class B beneficiaries include nieces and nephews, half-nieces and half-nephews, daughters-in-law and sons-in-law, aunts and uncles, and great grandchildren (by blood, by stepchild, or by child adopted during infancy). Class B beneficiaries are eligible for an exemption of $1,000 each. Class C - Class C beneficiaries include anyone not listed above as a Class A or a Class B beneficiary. Class C beneficiaries are eligible for an exemption of $500 each.Is Life Insurance Included in the Value of Kentucky Estate?Only life insurance that is payable to the decedent or the decedent's estate is included in the value of a Kentucky estate for state inheritance tax purposes.What Expenses Can Be Deducted From the Value of a Kentucky Estate?Certain expenses can be deducted from the value of a Kentucky estate, including:Funeral expenses not to exceed $5,000Expenses of administration, including executors'/administrators' commissions, attorneys' fees, appraisers' fees, and court costsDebts of the decedent, including real property taxes that were a lien against the decedent\u2019s property at the date of deathFederal estate tax in the proportion which the net estate in Kentucky subject to the federal estate taxes bearsWhat Are the Kentucky Inheritance Tax Rates?The Kentucky inheritance tax rates are as follows: Class B beneficiaries are subject to an inheritance tax ranging from 4% to 16% Class C beneficiaries are subject to an inheritance tax ranging from 6% to 16%For a chart showing the inheritance tax brackets, refer to pages 6 and 7 of A Guide to Kentucky Inheritance and Estate Taxes.What Kentucky Inheritance Tax Forms Must Be Filed and When Are They Due?If no Kentucky inheritance tax is due and a federal estate tax return (IRS Form 706) is also not required to be filed, then it will not be necessary to file a Kentucky inheritance tax return. Instead, an \"Affidavit of Exemption\" will be accepted for the final settlement and closing of the administration of an estate.For estates subject to the Kentucky inheritance tax, a Kentucky Inheritance Tax Return (Form 92A200, 92A202, or 92A205) must be filed and the inheritance tax paid within 18 months of the decedent's date of death, otherwise, interest and penalties will begin to accrue. If the inheritance tax is paid within 9 months of the date of death, then a 5% discount is applied.Where Can You Find Additional Information About Kentucky Inheritance Taxes?For more information about Kentucky inheritance taxes, refer to Kentucky Inheritance and Estate Tax Forms and Instructions.

{"title": "How to Get Your Money Back From an Internet Scam", "text": "Internet scammers can obtain your bank information by hacking sites and stores you've visited or simply by tricking you into divulging information or disbursing your funds. As a scam victim, you can file a police report, although Internet crime often crosses international borders, which can make prosecution tricky. Consequently, recovering your money from the scammers themselves can prove difficult or impossible. However, you can generally recover your losses if you act quickly and contact your bank. Laws protecting consumers from Internet-based financial fraud vary based upon the payment method.\n\nFraudsters can produce fake checks with stolen information.\n\ncredit: Jill Battaglia/iStock/Getty Images\n\nCredit Card Fraud\n\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act includes provisions that protect consumers from credit card fraud. You should notify your bank immediately if you have reason to believe your card details have been compromised. Most credit card companies have 24-hour hotlines to report such fraud. Hotline numbers are normally listed on the back of the card. While you are liable for up to $50 of charges if your physical card is lost or stolen, you have zero liability for Internet fraud or other situations when the card details rather than the physical card are compromised. Your card issuer may ask you to complete a fraud affidavit detailing the unsanctioned transactions. The issuer will credit your account and provide you with a new card.\n\nDebit Card Claims\n\nAs with credit cards, you have zero liability for fraudulent charges as long as you notify your bank of the issue before any charges hit your account. The Electronic Funds Act states that your bank can hold you liable for $50 of charges if you notify it of the fraud within two business days. Your liability rises to $500 if you take more than two days but less than 60 days to alert your bank of fraudulent charges. You have unlimited liability for charges if you wait more than 60 days to alert your bank. However, these deadlines are legal maximums and many banks voluntarily refund unauthorized charges. To report fraud, contact your bank's emergency hotline and complete a fraud affidavit.\n\nElectronic Debits\n\nOnline fraudsters can use your bank account and routing number to make electronic withdrawals from your account. Such debits are subject to regulations established by the National Automated Clearing House Association. You have zero liability for unauthorized ACH charges as long as you notify your bank within 60 days of the debits clearing your account. Thereafter, you assume full liability for any charges. You should contact your bank as soon as you notice any fraudulent debits, and you may need to complete an affidavit. Your bank may recommend closing the account to prevent future charges.\n\nCheck Fraud\n\nAside from ACH debits, an online fraudster could use your account and routing number to create duplicate checks. Fraudsters can then use the checks to make in-person withdrawals from your account. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, remotely created unauthorized checks are invalid. Consequently, liability for losses falls to the bank accepting the item rather than the account owner. You have zero liability for online based check fraud. Significantly, the UCC doesn't impose any timelines on consumers to report the fraud."}
{"title": "Refinance likely, thanks to equity cushion", "text": "Dear Dr. Don,\nI have a second home worth about $110,000 that has $57,000 remaining principal on a first mortgage at 6.375 percent with 11 years left on the loan. Our primary residence is paid off and worth about $320,000. I'd like to do some home improvements to our primary home (about $25,000) and am considering options such as a refinance.\nCan I combine the balance of the first loan with a home improvement loan and get more attractive rates using either property as the collateral? Our FICO score is over 800.\n-- Dave Denouement\nDear Dave,\nWhile lenders have gotten more conservative about cash-out refis, owning your first home free and clear makes borrowing $82,000 against the home with an estimated value of $320,000 -- especially with your credit score -- an easy decision for the loan committee.\nThe downside of a first mortgage refinance is the higher closing costs associated with that mortgage. Bankrate's national average for closing costs on a $200,000 loan in 2009 was $2,732. You should definitely look at a shorter-term mortgage, like a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, so you don't end up spending a ton of money on interest by extending out to 30 years. As I write this, Bankrate's national average for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 4.46 percent.\nThe interest rate differential between a new 15-year fixed-rate mortgage and your existing 6.375 percent mortgage on your second home should give you enough of a reduction in interest expense to justify the refi on its own. Getting the remodeling money at this rate versus prevailing rates on a home equity loan (7.76 percent) or home equity line of credit (5.76 percent) is another bonus.\nBankrate's Refinance interest savings calculator can help you figure out what you'll save on the refinancing component.\nDoing this maneuver with the second home should also work. If your estimate of the home's value comes close to the appraised value, you'll have a loan-to-value below 80 percent and won't have to pay private mortgage insurance.\nBankrate's content, including the guidance of its advice-and-expert columns and this Web site, is intended only to assist you with financial decisions.

{"title": "Why the Possession Date for Homebuyers Causes Such Controversy", "text": "The buyer possession date is often a problem. Some of it has to do with when the seller is vacating but not always. Without fail, it's the single biggest headache in most real estate transactions and the number-one problem that often rears its head midway through when needs or circumstances change. Sometimes, unfortunately, the date of buyer possession was never clear in the first place. This is when each of the parties, buyers, and sellers, may develop a contradictory expectation of possession.The Buyer Possession Date at ClosingBear in mind that closing doesn't always mean recordation of the deed because, in some parts of the country, counties are weeks behind in recording deeds. In those situations, closing happens when the money changes hands, the deed is drawn and all conditions of the contract have been met. Where I work in Sacramento, buyers don't get the keys until the title company has confirmed the deed has been recorded and conveyed that confirmation.Customary Buyer Possession DatesLocal custom will dictate how the buyer asks for possession, but possession is typically an issue agreed upon at purchase contract acceptance. It's not unusual for a buyer to receive keys on the day the transaction closes. In some parts of the country, buyers give the sellers a day or two after closing to move. Sometimes sellers rent back from buyers. Whatever you agree to, make sure it's in writing.How Market Conditions Can Influence Buyer Possession DatesIn seller's markets, buyers will often give sellers several days to move at no consideration to the buyer. This is to gain an edge in the event the seller receives multiple offers.In buyer's markets, buyers will generally insist upon occupancy at closing and have been known to refuse to close if the property isn't going to be vacant at closing.In neutral markets, possession is typically upon closing.Early Buyer PossessionAs a general rule, giving buyers early possession is frowned upon because too many things can go wrong at the last minute. Eviction is not always easy or inexpensive. For that reason, professionals advise that sellers and buyers execute rental agreements.Seller Rent-backs Retain PossessionBuyers want sellers to pay a sum equal to their mortgage payment, plus insurance and taxes. That amount is often a lot more than the seller's original mortgage payment. Whatever amount is agreed upon, put it in writing, and execute a rental agreement to protect all parties.Possession Delays Due to Loan Funding ConditionsEven the best-laid plans run afoul at times. Your contract can spell out precisely when occupancy is permitted, yet the transaction might not close on time. Common reasons involve the loan. By the time the loan documents are signed and the lender reviews them, the underwriter might call for a loan condition to be satisfied prior to funding. The satisfaction of that condition can easily delay the loan.A recent seller from Carmichael, CA, found that she could not find any movers to work on a holiday, the day she was supposed to vacate her home of 40 years. The buyers refused to give the seller an extra day to move out, claiming the seller should have made arrangements far in advance of her move-out day. Reluctantly, and at additional expense, the seller changed her moving day to meet the buyers' demands.At the last minute, the lender called for a loan condition and refused to fund the loan until the condition was met. Meeting the condition delayed closing by 2 days, but the buyers wanted the keys to the home on the day it was originally scheduled to close. They didn't want to physically move in. They wanted to shampoo the carpet. If you were the seller who had moved out and left the home vacant, under these conditions, would you have given the keys to these buyers?The seller, when informed that keys should not be handed to a buyer until a transaction closes, decided to withhold the keys. She was within her rights. Why risk a problem?Tip: Instead of specifying possession on a certain date, it's smarter to write contracts that give possession either on \"closing\" or X days before or X days after, not a specific date.At the time of writing, Elizabeth Weintraub, CalBRE #00697006, is a Broker-Associate at Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, California."}
{"title": "5 kids' holiday gifts that keep on giving", "text": "Museum and zoo memberships\nA museum or zoo membership is a great present -- if the recipients are interested in the offering.\n\"You have to keep in mind what the kid would enjoy,\" Braun says.\nIn addition to unlimited free member admissions, these memberships offer other perks such as parking passes, special member nights and passes for IMAX movies at the museum, says Jennifer Fink, a Milwaukee mom of four. She bought a museum membership as a family Christmas gift one year, saying the gift was consistent with their family values. \"This really expressed our values: time over material things, (and) learning and exploration,\" she says.\nFink's family benefited in other ways, too, because the membership allowed entrance into participating institutions. \"We used our museum membership to visit the Santa Barbara Museum of National History and the Ty Warner Sea Center, as well as the La Brea Tar Pits, when we traveled to California for my brother's wedding,\" she says.\nWhen buying a membership for other people, consider whether it's a place they'll go regularly. Fink says her family received a zoo membership as a gift, but they only liked to go once a year. \"Because we had the pass, we felt obligated to go at least twice that year,\" she says.\nIf purchasing an individual membership, remember that anyone accompanying the member might have to pay.\n\nSubscriptions\nA twist on \"of-the-month\" clubs: subscription boxes with themes from science projects to crafts are increasing in popularity. Subscriptions from companies such as Kiwi Crate, Green Kid Crafts and Kelly Kits mail your child a package each month filled with several craft activities and supplies.\n\"Particularly for the holidays, when kids are deluged with new toys and gifts, a monthly gift subscription is a great way to keep the fun going long after they tire of their new toys,\" says Penny Bauder, founder and CEO of Green Kid Crafts. \"Not to mention that kids love getting things in the mail, so a new surprise showing up at their door each month is really exciting for them.\"\nThe projects are a great topic for the gift-giver and receiver to chat about as well. \"We hear from a lot of long-distance givers, especially grandparents and aunts and uncles, who say that they are so happy they sent a gift subscription. Every month, they get a call or a letter from their recipient telling them all about that month's theme and the fun crafts they made,\" says Bauder.\nMagazines are also a good gift. Melinda Joffe of Mountain View, California, has her sister and mom give her three kids subscriptions to magazines such as American Girl, Mad Magazine and Appleseeds.\n\"They love it when the magazines arrive,\" she says.\n\nDonations\nHolidays aren't just a time for receiving; they're a time for giving. Making a charitable donation in the kids' names can be rewarding -- if done right.\nKids need to have a connection, says Braun, and donating an animal through an organization such as Heifer International can make that happen. \"I suggest that the kids get something out of it. Whether you buy two sheep or a cow, the kids really like that,\" she says.\nThe donation also provides a learning experience, says Allison Stephens, a spokeswoman at Heifer International, a nonprofit dedicated to ending hunger and poverty.\n\"The livestock angle is something the kids can get behind, and what the livestock provides: milk, eggs and nourishment,\" she says, adding that the website has engaging, interactive features to help children learn about how their donations make a difference to the families receiving them.\nBut no matter what charity you choose, says Stephens, \"It's (about) the conversation between a parent and a child about how important it is to find an organization or cause you care about, and how you donate to that charity.\"\n\nExperiences\nSharing enjoyable experiences is an excellent way to give a child something to remember. \"Any gift that allows the child to spend time alone with a parent or grandparent, away from a sibling, is special,\" says Braun.\nFor Fink, she says she sometimes buys two season subscriptions to a local performing arts series as a Christmas gift. \"I've always loved theater, and they do great shows. I knew it would be fun to take the kids,\" she says.\nExperiences like this \"are the most brilliant gifts because they'll never forget that Grandma or Mom took them to see 'The Lion King,'\" says Braun.\nIf you're having trouble thinking of an experience, a company such as Cloud 9 Living can help. Some of its most popular experiences for kids include whitewater rafting, stock car ride-alongs or learning to fly, says Bobby Augst, executive vice president of Cloud 9 Living.\nAugst says 10 years from now, when your kids think back to that holiday or birthday, they won't remember the video game or gift card you gave them. \"But they'll remember the time they went for a ride in a stock car for the rest of their lives,\" he says.\nSmaller experience gifts are just as entertaining -- like a trip to the movies or a nighttime hike, Braun says.\n\"In the end, this is the gift that keeps on giving. They'll remember that much better than Star Wars Legos,\" she says.\n\nClasses and lessons\nFor a different type of experience, lessons and other classes can make for great long-lasting gifts. If your children like certain sports or musical instruments, it can be a great option for them to polish their craft. These kinds of gifts can also allow a child to try an activity he or she has been considering that he might not otherwise get a chance to participate in.\nSue Poremba of State College, Pennsylvania, gave her 10-year-old son the Christmas gift of track camp one year.\n\"My son was very interested in running and track at the time, and the camp was geared toward younger kids,\" she says.\nWhile her son had a great time at the camp, Poremba says in hindsight, she would change how she gave it. \"We didn't really have anything to wrap up except the voucher to get into the class,\" she says. She recommends getting some of the associated items from the camp to include in the wrapped gift. In her case, things such as a T-shirt from the camp plus a water bottle and other running-related items would have made a great theme gift.\nCARD SEARCH: Find a credit card that fits your lifestyle at Bankrate.com."}
{"title": "Why Mortgage Refinancing Might Not Be a Smart Move For You", "text": "Mortgage refinancing is all the rage when interest rates drop. Rates don't have to drop very far, either, before scores of home owners decide that refinancing their mortgages makes sense. But it doesn't always make financial sense to refinance. Sometimes, mortgage refinancing is the worst thing you can do. What is Mortgage Refinancing?Refinancing a mortgage means the owners are paying off their existing mortgage and replacing that mortgage with a new loan. Generally, the costs associated with mortgage refinancing are rolled into the loan, meaning they are added to the existing balance, increasing the loan amount.When a loan amount is increased, an owner's equity is decreased.It is possible to increase the principal balance of a mortgage and lower the existing mortgage payment. That's why many borrowers gravitate toward mortgage refinancing. To lower the existing mortgage payment, the term of the loan is extended. But a lower payment might not pay off in the long run. It's often a short-term resolution. Why Mortgage Refinancing Extends the Term of Your MortgageWhen the term of the loan is extended, it will take longer to pay that mortgage in full. If you took out a loan when you bought your home, it was probably a 30-year loan. Say you decide to refinance your mortgage at the end of 5 years. Instead of looking forward to paying off your loan in 25 years at this point, you will now be paying on that mortgage for a total period of 35 years.If your original loan was amortized for 30 years on a $100,000 mortgage at 6% interest, your monthly payment is $599.55. If you refinance that mortgage at $103,000, at 5.5%, your new payment is $584.82. Your loan will reset to a 30-year term. Most borrowers select a 30-year amortization period.You will make an extra 60 months of payments and pay $35,065 more over the life of the loan, should you live in the property long enough to pay off your loan. If you decide to sell after mortgage refinancing, you will lose $3,000 of equity, plus whatever principal balance you had paid down on the original $100,000 loan. Costs Associated With Mortgage RefinancingYou will either pay for the costs of mortgage refinancing through a higher interest rate or those fees will be added to your unpaid mortgage balance because few homeowners pay those costs in cash. There is no free ride. Following are typical fees paid to obtain a refinance: AppraisalTitle PolicyEscrowLoan PointsOriginationProcessingUnderwritingWireBeneficiary DemandApplicationAdministrationReconveyanceCredit ReportNotaryE-mail docTax serviceRecordingIt's hardly worth it to refinance your mortgage to save $15 a month under these circumstances. Most mortgage experts say you should be able to recoup your costs from mortgage refinancing over a 3-year period. If you've saved only $15 a month and it cost you $3,000 in fees, it would take 200 months to break even.However, if your total costs to refinance your mortgage cost you $3,000, for example, and you saved $50 a month in your mortgage payment by lowering it by that amount, you would break even at the end of 5 years. Sometimes people turn into serial refinancers, and every time interest rates drop a half a point or a point, they rush to refinance, thinking they are doing the smart thing when often it is the opposite.If you are in doubt, ask a real estate professional who doesn't have a dog in the race, like an appraiser, or an escrow officer, or even a real estate agent to compute the math for you. Because if you ask a mortgage lender if you should refinance, most often the answer to that question is yes.At the time of writing, Elizabeth Weintraub, CalBRE #00697006, is a Broker-Associate at Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, California."}
{"title": "How to Tell if Neighbors Are Stealing Your Electricity", "text": "Electric companies and consumers lose billions of dollars annually to electricity theft. Drug dealers use stolen electricity to power indoor marijuana growing operations and meth labs. In addition, a poor economy has caused electricity theft to rise as people who are struggling to make ends meet resort to desperate measures to keep the power on. The high bills associated with stolen electricity aren't the only shock you may encounter. Stolen electricity can be dangerous.

{"title": "How the Eurozone Crisis Affects You", "text": "The eurozone debt crisis was the world's greatest threat in 2011, according to the OECD. Things only got worse in 2012. The crisis started in 2009, when the world first realized Greece could default on its debt. In three years, it escalated into the potential for sovereign debt defaults from Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain. The European Union, led by Germany and France, struggled to support these members. They initiated bailouts from the ECB (European Central Bank) and IMF (International Monetary Fund). These measures didn't keep many from questioning the viability of the euro itself.How the Eurozone Crisis Affects YouIf those countries had defaulted, it would have been worse than the 2008 financial crisis.Banks, the primary holders of sovereign debt, would face huge losses. Smaller banks would have collapsed. In a panic, they'd cut back on lending to each other. The LIBOR rate would skyrocket like it did in 2008.The European Central Bank (ECB) held a lot of sovereign debt. Default would have jeopardized its future. It threatened the survival of the EU itself. Uncontrolled sovereign debt defaults could create a recession, if not a global depression.It could have been worse than the 1998 sovereign debt crisis. When Russia defaulted, other emerging market countries did too. The IMF stepped in, backed by the power of European countries and the United States. This time, it's not the emerging markets, but the developed markets that are in danger of default. The major backers of the IMF -- Germany, France and the United States -- are themselves highly indebted. There would be little political appetite to add to that debt to fund the massive bailouts needed.What Was the Solution?In May 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel developed a six-point plan. It went against newly-elected French President Francois Hollande's proposal to create Eurobonds. He also wanted to cut back on austerity measures, and create more economic stimulus. Merkel's plan would:Launch quick-start programs to facilitate business start-ups.Relax protections against wrongful dismissal.Introduce \"mini-jobs\" with lower taxes.Combine apprenticeship with vocational education targeted toward youth unemployment.Create special funds and tax benefits to privatize state-owned businesses.Establish special economic zones, like those in China.Invest in renewable energy.Merkel found this worked to integrate East Germany. She saw how austerity measures could boost the competitiveness of the entire eurozone.The six-point plant followed an intergovernmental treaty approved December 8, 2011. The EU leaders agreed to create a fiscal unity parallel to the monetary union that already exists. The treaty did three things. First, it enforced the budget restrictions of the Maastricht Treaty. Second, it reassured lenders that the EU would stand behind its members' sovereign debt. Third, it allowed the EU to act as a more integrated unit.  Specifically, the treaty would create five changes:Eurozone member countries would legally give some budgetary power to centralized EU control.Members that exceeded the 3% deficit-to-GDP ratio would face financial sanctions. Any plans to issue sovereign debt must be reported in advance.The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was replaced by a permanent bailout fund. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) became effective in July 2012. The permanent fund assured lenders that the EU would stand behind its members. That  lowered the risk of default. Voting rules in the ESM would allow emergency decisions to be passed with an 85% qualified majority. This allows the EU to act more quickly.Eurozone countries would lend another \u20ac200 billion to the IMF from their central banks.This followed a bailout in May 2010. EU leaders pledged 720 billion euros ($928 billion) to prevent the from triggering another Wall Street flash crash. The bailout restored faith in the euro, which slid to a 14-month low against the dollar.The United States and China intervened after the ECB said it would not rescue Greece. LIBOR rose as banks started to panic, just like in 2008, Only this time banks were avoiding each others' toxic Greece debt, instead of mortgage-backed securities.What Are the Consequences?The UK and several other EU countries that aren't part of the eurozone balked at Merkel's treaty. They worried the treaty would lead to a \"two-tier\" EU. Eurozone countries could create preferential treaties for their members only. They would exclude EU countries that don't have the euro.Second, eurozone countries must agree to cutbacks in spending. This could slow their economic growth, as it has in Greece. These austerity measures have been politically unpopular. Voters could bring in new leaders, who might leave the eurozone or the EU itself.Third, a new form of financing -- the Eurobond -- becomes available. The ESM would be funded by \u20ac700 billion in euro bonds, fully guaranteed by the eurozone countries. Like U.S. Treasuries, these bonds could be bought and sold on a secondary market. By competing with Treasuries, the Eurobonds could lead to higher interest rates in the United States. (Source: CNN, Will new deal solve Europe's problems?, December 9, 2011)What's at Stake?Debt ratings agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's wanted the ECB to step up and guarantee all euro zone members' debts. But EU leader Germany opposed such a move without assurances that debtor countries will install the austerity measures needed to put their fiscal houses in order. Germany does not want to write a blank euro check just to reassure investors. German voters wouldn't be too happy about paying higher taxes to fund the bailout. Germany is also paranoid about potential inflation. Its people remember only too well the hyperinflation of the 1920s.In addition, investors worry that austerity measures, needed in the long run, will only slow the economic rebound debtor countries need to repay their debts. (Source: CNBC, \"S&P Says Eurozone May Need Another Shock\", Euro Crisis Pits Germany and U.S. in Tactical Fight, December 12, 2011)CausesFirst, there were no penalties for countries that violated the debt-to-GDP ratios set by the EU's founding Maastricht Criteria. Why not? France and Germany also were spending above the limit. They'd be hypocritical to sanction others until they got their own houses in order. There were no teeth in any sanctions except expulsion from the eurozone, which would weaken the power of the euro itself. The EU wanted to strengthen the euro's power, putting pressure on non-eurozone EU members, like the UK, Denmark and Sweden, to adopt it. (Source: BBC News, Greece Joins Eurozone, January 1, 2001; Greece to Join Euro, June 1, 2000).Second, eurozone countries initially benefited from the low interest rates and increased investment capital made possible by the euro's power. Most of this flow of capital was from Germany and France to the southern nations. This increased liquidity raised wages and prices, making their exports less competitive. Because they were on the euro, they couldn't do what most countries do to cool inflation -- raise interest rates or print less currency. Public spending rose, while tax revenues fell, during the recession to pay for unemployment and other benefits. (Source: New York Times, Paul Krugman, Killing the Euro. December 1, 2011)Third, although there are good arguments for austerity measures, they might only slow economic growth by being too restrictive. For example, the OECD said austerity measures would make Greece more competitive by improving its public finance management and reporting, cutbacks on public employee pensions and wages, and lowering its trade barriers. In fact, exports have risen. More important, the OECD said Greece needed to crack down on tax dodgers, and sell off state-owned businesses, to raise funds. (Source: OECD, Economic Survey of Greece 2011)In return for austerity measures, Greece's debt was cut in half. However, these measures also slowed the Greek economy. They increased unemployment, cut back consumer spending, and reduced capital needed for lending. Greek voters were fed up with the recession. They shut down the Greek government by giving an equal number of votes to the \"no austerity\" Syriza party. Another election was held on June 17 that narrowly defeated Syriza. The new government worked to continue with austerity, rather than leave the eurozone. For more, see Greece Debt Crisis."}
{"title": "Shareholders Duties", "text": "Individuals who purchase shares of a corporation's common stock have certain duties and rights \u2014 enforced by federal and state laws \u2014 within the corporation. A majority shareholder is among those who together control 51 percent or more of a corporation's outstanding shares of common stock. Minority shareholders own less than 50 percent of the outstanding shares. The duties of majority shareholders differ from those of minority shareholders.Shareholders must understand their duties and rights to remain in compliance with securities laws and protect their investment interest in a corporation.Majority shareholders must exercise a duty of fairness when dealing with a controlled corporation and minority shareholders. A duty of fairness includes full disclosure to affected parties. Minority shareholders may challenge certain actions of majority shareholders if a conflict of interest exists or if the majority shareholders are not acting in the best interest of the company. According to an article written on the American Bar Association's website, examples of situations minority shareholders may challenge include majority shareholders entering into significant contracts with the corporation or attempting to eliminate minority shareholders of the organization through a freeze-out, a technique used to force minority shareholders to accept cash payments for their shares so that the majority shareholders can acquire all of the remaining shares of the corporation.Shareholders do not have the right to vote on day-to-day management decisions. One of the duties and privileges of minority shareholders is the right to vote on the corporation\u2019s board of directors, who in turn appoint managers. The election of directors takes place during scheduled meetings of shareholders, show may appoint proxies to vote on their behalf. This occurs in many public corporations. According to an article written on the website of eNotes, a shareholder must submit in writing the appointment of a proxy, and the proxy is not required to be a shareholder. Other topics shareholders might vote on in a meeting are potential mergers, changes to the articles of incorporation and amendments to the corporate bylaws.In many corporations, corporate officers and directors are majority shareholders. Minority shareholders who feel as if majority shareholders failed in their fiduciary duties may file a lawsuit in a federal court to protect their ownership interests. According to Paula J. Dalley of the Houston Business and Tax Law Journal, majority shareholders have fiduciary duties because they possess the power to make decisions that affect the financial well-being of minority shareholders. A breach of fiduciary duty involves all of the corporation\u2019s shareholders and should be addressed through a derivative suit, which acts as representative of a group of shareholders instead of only one.In most cases, shareholders are not personally liable for decisions made by the corporation. Creditors may not pursue shareholders if the corporation is behind on its debt. However, stock investments are not guaranteed by the FDIC. If a company fails financially, shareholders may lose their entire investments. In the case of bankruptcy, holders of common stocks are the last to get paid if anything is left over after all assets are sold to pay for liabilities."}
{"title": "How to Creatively Spruce Up Your Event", "text": "A common denominator in event planning is creativity. No one sets out to coordinate the \u201cmost uninspired meeting of all time.\u201d Event planners want to be remembered for integrating originality and imagination into their events. Often times though there is a boundary to our creativity. It could be a limited budget or a conservative theme that leaves us wondering where we can sneak in a dash of personality.To help conquer situations like this, we've outlined some of the nearly-infinite event components where planners can add their creative touch. Next to each one, you\u2019ll see an example of how to invigorate these details beyond the standard fare.Event TitleYour title is the first thing that sells prospective attendees on your event.Standard Example: The 23rd Annual Black & White BallCreative Example: 23 Years in the Making\u2026 Tuxedos under TwilightInvitationsThis is another first impression element that should effectively market your event.Standard Example: White card with plain text in a white envelope.Creative Example: Bright envelope with image-rich postcards that describe the occasion.VenueA special location can spark excitement weeks before the event takes place.Standard Example: Hotel meeting room.Creative Example: Restaurant or private suite at an arena or ballpark.CateringEvery meeting and theme can be partnered with a unique food experience.Standard Example: Grilled chicken with rice.Creative Example: Chipolte BBQ pork loin served with mashed sweet potatoes.LightingLighting is one of the most basic elements of design, and it can be used in a variety of ways.Standard Example: Spotlights on stage.Creative Example: Colorful uplighting to illuminate walls and white linens.Seating ArrangementsAfter registration, the next top concern for guests is where they will be seated.Standard Example: Round tables of 8.Creative Example: Crescent rounds of 6 to eliminate guests having their backs to the stage.Design PropsProps come in many different forms, from simple stage ferns to detailed scenery motifs.Standard Example: Backdrops and banners on the stage.Creative Example: Themed inflatables set outside the room or venue entrance.StaffGreeters, servers, and registration staff can integrate the theme of your event into their uniforms.Standard Example: Monogrammed polo shirts and khakis.Creative Examples: Sports uniforms, construction hats, or costumes.Stage DesignThe stage is the focal point throughout the event so keep it visible and engaging.Standard Example: 8x12 rectangular stage centered on the wall.Creative Example: Runway stage that extends into the audience for more engagement.Table LinensNapkins by themselves have the capacity to become a visual design element.Standard Example: White table linens with burgundy flat-folded napkins.Creative Example: Floor-length table linens in a solid color with contrasting napkins in a pyramid fold.Chair CoversEven the nicest banquet chairs look complacent at a large event.Standard Example: White linen chair cover with a bow tie.Creative Example: Spandex stretch covers that match the table linens.Guest SpeakersSpeakers and their message represent the content of your event and thus are tied closely to its success.Standard Example: Vice President of Sales and Marketing.Creative Example: Celebrity or outside presenter who can tie past success with your company\u2019s objectives.EntertainmentEntertainers can perform before or after the content to add another unique element to the occasion.Standard Example: DJ or Jazz Trio.Creative Examples: Recording artists or talented performers from an area school.CenterpiecesWhatever sits in the center of each guest table will be viewed for hours. Don\u2019t waste the opportunity!Standard Example: Fresh cut flowers or potable plants that can be taken home by guests.Creative Examples: Ceramic artwork, picture collages or fiber optic centerpieces.Table CardsThese are the signs placed at each table to identify the table number or guest seating position.Standard Example: Printed card stock.Creative Example: Framed table numbers that match the d\u00e9cor of the table.These are just some of the nooks and crannies where planners can add a creative touch to events. The truth is that just about any facet of event production can be customized in some manner. The easiest way to get inspired is to attend as many industry conferences as you can and network with other planners when possible."}
{"title": "4 landmark moves of consumer protection", "text": "savings\n4 landmark moves of consumer protection\nThe world is a slightly safer place for consumers since the American economy unraveled. In the wake of the financial crisis, regulators and lawmakers got tough on some of the worst actors at the root of the recession and wrote a pile of checks to stimulate the economy. After all the fiscal spending and regulatory maneuvering, Americans won a handful of potentially lasting consumer protections. Here's a look at what's changed since Wall Street came apart at the seams. Dodd-Frank Act Though the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act focused more on ways to prevent the worst of the Wall Street excesses, consumers did score some wins in the wake of the financial crisis. The results have been mixed. The crowning achievement of Dodd-Frank as far as consumers go was the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\"It is the biggest consumer victory since deposit insurance in the wake of the last time the banks wrecked the economy with their reckless practices,\" says Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Many rules from the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented or written. The act called for about 250 new regulations, and many deadlines have been missed. Regulators have struggled with funding constraints, legal challenges, and opposition from Congress and the financial industry. \"There are about 120 rules to come. We're less than halfway through it. If the second half is as voluminous, we'll be working on it in 2017 with a new president,\" says John Alan James, executive director of the Center for Global Governance, Reporting and Regulation at Pace University's Lubin School of Business in New York. In an attempt to avoid that ignominious end to the legislation, President Barack Obama met with regulators in August to press them to speed up the process. Durbin Amendment The Durbin Amendment, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, set caps on the interchange fees that big banks can charge to merchants when a customer swipes a debit card. Banks with more than $10 billion in assets saw their fee revenue from debit card purchases cut in half. \"Durbin lowered debit card swipe fees that force cash customers without credit or debit cards to pay more at the store or more at the pump,\" Mierzwinski says. \"Stores embed the swipe fees -- used to pay for the rewards of affluent customers -- into the cost of all products because Visa and MasterCard rules make it difficult to offer cash discounts or impose card surcharges, which are illegal in some states.\" Though the cap on fees has helped some merchants, small merchants now pay higher interchange fees, according to an April report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That's because retailers who deal mainly in small-denomination transactions were able to pay lower fees for small purchases prior to the rule. However, card networks now have eliminated the discounts for small purchases, forcing merchants to pay the maximum for all transactions, except those on cards from smaller banks. The cap is 21 cents plus 0.05 percent of the transaction value, according to the Richmond Fed."}
{"title": "How To Build Credit - 9 Myths Debunked", "text": "credit\n Like child-rearing and curing ailments, credit building is chock-full of old wives' tales that don't pan out. Smart financial moves such as closing accounts or paying off loans early may not be the credit boosters you think they are. Sadly, there are no real quick fixes despite what some commercials or online credit repair ads might proclaim. The key to increasing your credit score is good payment behavior along with time and a healthy mix of credit types. FREE TOOL: Worried there may be mistakes on your credit report? Check it for free at myBankrate right now. To help you sort the fact from the fiction, Bankrate tackles these 9 long-held but bogus beliefs that won't help you build better credit. 1. It helps to opt out of credit card offers Many consumers assume if they opt out of credit card offers, there will be fewer credit inquiries on their credit reports, says John Ulzheimer, the owner operator at The Ulzheimer Group and former president of consumer education at CreditSesame. However, he says those inquiries are considered \"soft\" inquiries and don't affect your credit score. You can keep the offers coming if you'd like, but doing so won't help you build better credit. If you want to opt out of offers to reduce your junk mail, call toll free (888) 5-OPT-OUT, or (888) 567-8688, or visit OptOutPrescreen.com to remove your name from the credit reporting agency lists for unsolicited credit and insurance offers. That will remove your name for 5 years. To keep your name off the list, mail in the permanent opt-out election form available on the website. Consumers can also opt in on the website if they've already opted out.\n2. You can bump hard inquiries off report\nA \"hard\" inquiry is generated when creditors pull your report or score after you apply for a loan or line of credit. Your score falls because it shows you're interested in taking on more credit and therefore, more risk. Other inquiries are considered \"soft,\" such as those triggered by you, your employer or companies sending credit card offers in the mail.\nSome consumers believe if they pull their credit report every day to load up on \"soft\" inquiries, they will bump off the hard ones that weigh on their credit score.\n\"It's speculative. There's no indication there's a finite amount of space for inquiries,\" says Ulzheimer. And it's only a small part of the score. \"There's better bang for your buck if you do more legitimate things.\"\n3. Closing old accounts boosts your score\nThis is a hard-to-kill-off myth. Closing accounts typically won't help your score and could possibly dent it, says Trey Loughran, chief marketing officer at Equifax. The results can shorten your credit history eventually and leave you with a smaller amount of available credit, both of which can harm your efforts to build better credit.\nThe length of credit history shows how seasoned of a borrower you are, so the more positive experience you have, the better. Having more available credit helps to keep your utilization rate low. The utilization rate is how much available credit a borrower uses; the lower the percentage, the better.\n\"Say you have $100 in debt with $1,000 in allowable credit across multiple accounts and you close a credit card with a limit of $500, then you doubled your utilization rate from 10% to 20%,\" Loughran says.\nFREE TOOL: The higher your credit score, the lower the interest rate you may be able to get. Check your score for free at myBankrate now.\n4. Multiple accounts improve your score\nSome consumers with credit problems believe opening many accounts will be proof that they can handle credit. Actually, it has the opposite effect.\n\"That makes lenders scratch their heads and wonder why you need all that credit,\" says Rod Griffin, director of public education at Experian. \"It's a sign of risk.\" Your credit score can suffer as a result.\nWhat lenders will see is a boatload of new, hard inquiries on your credit report. Those inquiries will deduct from your credit score, while lenders will worry that you're in dire financial straits and desperately need access to credit to make ends meet.\n5. Paid-off delinquencies restore score\nNope. It will help, but don't expect a supersized boost, says Ulzheimer. That's because the delinquency will stay on your report, even if it has a zero balance.\nMost derogatory information such as late payments, collection accounts, charged-off accounts, tax liens and judgments live on your credit report for 7 years before dropping off. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy can linger on your report from 7 to 10 years, while Chapter 7 bankruptcies remain on your credit report for 10 years.\n\"Don't expect your score to recover to what it was before the incident, because it ain't going to happen,\" Ulzheimer says. \"The more important part is the incident.\"\n6. Paying off loans early is better than making payments\n\"It's a Catch-22,\" says Sarah Davies, senior vice president of product management and analytics for VantageScore Solutions, because while it may be good for your personal finances to pay off a loan, it doesn't do much for your credit score.\nIndeed, a closed, paid-off account adds to your score, but an open credit account in good standing boosts it more.\nThat's because an open account shows you're consistently handling credit wisely. A closed account only shows good payment behavior in the past and becomes less and less predictive of future habits.\nFREE TOOL: When is the last time you checked your credit report? Get it free now at myBankrate.\n7. Paying before the due date helps your credit score\nYour credit score takes into account how much available credit you're using. Paying a credit card balance in full ahead of the due date won't help your utilization ratio -- and thereby improve your score. That strategy doesn't work because the balance of the account has already been reported to the credit agency, says Ulzheimer.\nHowever, if you pay the balance in full before the statement closing date, which appears on your statement, then your report will post a zero balance for that account. That will help your utilization rate -- or how much credit you are using -- along with your credit score, says Ulzheimer.\nTo get started, you will have to pay one credit card bill earlier than usual and then consider your statement date as your due date, says Ulzheimer. Also, you will need to check your balance online or over the phone to make sure you pay the correct amount.\n8. All delinquencies are created equal\nIf you're in the unenviable position of having to miss a payment, choose carefully. Missing a mortgage or auto loan payment will ding your credit more than skipping a credit card payment will. \"Those are more substantive debts, so they carry more weight in the credit score,\" Davies says.\nOf course, missing a payment is a last resort. Pay the minimum amount to keep accounts current. To head off a catastrophe, contact a nonprofit credit counseling service that can help you work with your lenders to come up with a more affordable, temporary payment plan or another solution.\n9. You can't have negatives on your report\n\"I'm here to tell you that you can have anything from a 30-day missed payment to a bankruptcy on your report and still have a really good score,\" says Barry Paperno, former consumer affairs manager for myFICO.com.\nThe most recent information on credit reports is weighted more heavily than older data, Paperno says. So, if you have a bankruptcy from 5 years ago, but have had good credit performance since, it's possible to have a 700 FICO score.\nTo build better credit, Paperno preaches consistent good payment behavior instead of a quick fix. The advice is simple: Pay the minimum payment every month at least, if not the full balance. Diversify your account types and keep balances low. The result will be a higher credit score.\nFREE TOOL: Ready to use a credit card wisely? Before applying for one, check your credit for free at myBankrate."}
{"title": "Real Estate Website Forms and Drip Email: How to Follow Up Effectively", "text": "I am the world's WORST real estate professional when it comes to any type of personal networking. I simply do not do it. Because I'm also a writer, when I'm not involved in a real estate transaction, I'm sitting in my writer's chair pounding the keyboard. I'm somewhat of a hermit. I tell you this because I know that you can be successful in generating real estate website leads and a nice business flow without doing any personal networking. If you also network, all the better, and more business for you.Using PPC, Pay Per Click, advertising since the day I moved to the state and town in which I currently live, I've built a nice business. 100% of my business has come from my website, and always will. Yes, I get referrals, but they come from clients and customers who first found me on the Internet, then used my services and referred me. So, the second tier of client came from the website as well.Let's assume that you've read other articles, perhaps in series with this one, that have convinced you that you can succeed with website marketing. You've followed the \"best practices\" tips for how to do PPC advertising, create the ads and landing pages, and place great content on your website. You've also created some special reports, white papers, or an eBook to offer your site visitors in return for their contact information. You're ready to place these report offers on relevant site pages, and it's time to develop a \"form\" to gather their contact information and place them into your system for follow-up. This is critical, as they're probably weeks to months away from a transaction, so you need to stay top-of-mind with every prospect.You may have a CRM, Customer Relationship Management, system that can take the information from a form and create a new prospect profile. I'm going to be giving you specific tools in this article to create a form, have it place the prospect into a follow-up system, and automatically send them a series of emails. I'll be using two tools that can be absolutely free, but definitely are very low cost. These tools work together to automate your lead capture and follow-up to keep more prospects until they're ready to do business.There are a number of good website forms creation applications, both as software and as online services. I settled on Wufoo forms for several reasons:free or very inexpensive, depending on the number of forms and trafficeasy to use and create forms that look good on my siteintegrates with the auto-responder and drip email solution I likeMailChimp is my follow-up email solution, and I'll go into some detail on the next page. However, MailChimp's forms application wasn't what I wanted, and Wufoo integrates well, so that's why I'm using the two products.At the free service level, Wufoo provides 1 user, 3 forms, 3 reports, 10 total form fields, and 100 form entries/month. This may be enough for many real estate websites, but the next level significantly expands the capabilities and features.Wufoo Forms Features - Go to the site for details, but Wufoo forms can be customized with various field types, styles and even branded with themes. Fields can be required or optional, including drop-down type fields for choices.Wufoo Reports - Using the Reports builder, you can create reports with charts and graphs to show you at a glance how your lead capture is going.Wufoo - MailChimp Integration - Since it's a bit difficult to find, the page for integration of Wufoo forms into MailChimp is here.Real Estate Website Forms TipsWhile you may have done everything right up to this point, getting the site visitor to a relevant page and generating interest in a report you're offering with a form, you haven't won until they submit the form. Some tips:Keep the form short and simple, too many fields will cause them to stop and leave.Only require name and email for most forms, as requiring a phone number will cut submissions.Keep the form close to the explanation of the offer, report or eBook.Have a thank-you message pop up when they finish.Tell them in the form what's going to happen, like \"Your report will be delivered automatically by email.I have Wufoo deliver the report automatically and immediately after they submit the form. Then the integration with Mailchimp sends their information over for more email follow-up. Once you've achieved a balance of valuable free information on your site and special reports and enhanced information offered by these forms, you'll begin to see new leads.Whether you've paid for a site visitor with PPC, Pay Per Click, marketing or managed to get them to your site with SEO or other site marketing, it's what you do after they arrive that makes the difference between nice website stats and a commission. Assuming that you've managed to get them to fill out a form and give you their contact information in exchange for a report, eBook or other material, now it's time to follow up in a way that keeps them engaged until they're ready to buy or sell real estate.While there are many good drip email services, I chose MailChimp. The free level has been good enough for my uses so far, as it allows some liberal emailing to a list of hundreds. The free level allows up to 1,000 subscribers and 6,000 emails/month. However, the other features will more than justify moving up to a paid level.What You Can Do With Your MailChimp AccountCreate single auto-responder emailsCreate a series of auto-responders, drip emailTrack opens, unsubscribes, link clicks and much more for every email deliveredHave MailChimp handle all subscriptions and CANSPAM requirementsIntegrate with other services like Google Analytics, Wufoo Forms, Facebook and moreCompare the performance of your email campaigns to all real estate related accounts with MailChimpHow I Use \u200bReal Estate Drip Email for Follow-UpI probably have a very different strategy for follow-up, or drip email, than other real estate professionals. I'm very low-key and do not want to risk alienating my prospects. One way that I do that is to have a short series, usually only 4 emails, for a drip campaign for new subscribers. In other words, when someone new fills out a form and is pulled into my automated system, they are only going to get five emails. This would be the one that delivers the material they requested, usually immediately, followed by a series of four emails over a couple of weeks.I found that telling them what was going to happen cut my \"unsubscribes\" significantly after delivery of the first in the four email series. In other words, I tell them in the first email that there will only be four. This takes away the \"unknown\" factor about how much I'm going to bother them. The next page of this article contains the text of all four of my emails after the one delivering their report. You'll see how I try to keep them engaged and my site as the preferred place to go for local real estate information.My Goal for a Drip Email CampaignI have found through 10 years of experience doing this type of marketing for a real estate website, that an email every three months is enough contact with my prospects. This is in addition to a VERY occasional email about statistics or releasing a special report of some kind. Remember that I said VERY occasional. So, my quarterly email becomes a quarterly statistical report of sold properties for the previous 3 months. I link the recipients to the PDF report online, and I've experienced CTRs (Click Through Ratios) that greatly exceed the industry averages. That's because prospective buyers and sellers both want to know what's happening with the market.Feel free to get ideas or even copy text that works for you out of these email examples. I am currently sending a four email series to new prospects from report delivery forms on my real estate website. Here is the text of those emails and the schedule:Email #1 - Goes out 2 days after they hit the list.Thanks & More Taos InfoWe appreciate your recent request for information or special reports from [brokerage name here]. We wanted to follow up with this email and another three over the next couple of weeks to familiarize you with the website and the wealth of Taos area and real estate information there.One of the first questions many visitors have is how to know where all of these MLS, Multiple Listing Service, areas are. There are more than 40 of them, and since we cover an area larger than Taos County, knowing where these areas are can help in tailoring your searches to provide listings where you really want to be.Just take this link to a map with all of the areas pinned, or even better, take this link to a page with the areas named and linked to specific information about each. There will be maps, water well depth information, and photos or videos for most of the areas.Thanks again for your interest, and remember that [brokerage name here] is a Buyer Dedicated Broker, not taking listings in order to serve buyers without any conflicts of interest.************************************************>>>Note: This first email tells them what's going to happen, no surprises. Doing this cut my first email unsubscribes substantially. It also offers them valuable help in sorting out all of the MLS areas.Email #2 - Goes out 5 days after they hit the list.Let The System Do Your Taos Real Estate SearchesIf you're like most Taos real estate searchers, you come into the site on a regular basis and enter your search criteria again, looking for new listings you haven't seen before. However, you don't need to do this.I can create a custom alert search for you that takes your criteria and tells the MLS to send you an email alert with the details of every new listing that matches your search criteria, and on the day it's entered. It will also alert you when one of your matches has a price change, allowing you to watch for bargains.To get one going for you, just go to this form and give me the details of the type of property you are interested in. I'll build your custom search and you'll start to receive alerts right away.************************************************************************************************** \u200b>>>Note: Those who opt for these automated reports are my best prospects, as it usually indicates that they're closer to a buying decision than others. Almost every one of my buyer transactions is with someone getting these alerts.Email #3 - Goes out 8 days after they hit the list.See Much More Taos Listing InfoWhen you're using our Taos real estate search page, you are seeing what's called an IDX search. All of the brokers in the Taos MLS have agreed to participate so that you see all of the listings in a search on any broker's site. However, this agreement limits the amount of information, or number of fields of information, that we are allowed to publish.So, you're seeing the same fields of information no matter which brokerage site you're searching on. The difference in using the [brokerage name here] search is the exclusive form on the left side of the search screen. Notice that there is a form for entering your name, email address and MLS numbers. When you come across listings in your search that you'd like to know more about, you can enter the MLS numbers as you go in the form.Once you're ready, submit the form, and it will send me those MLS numbers. I will create a report for you with those listings, but with MUCH more information, at least 40 more fields of information actually. You'll know a LOT more about the listing, including a link under the main photo which takes you to documents the listing broker has attached, like surveys, floor plans, disclosures and more.To speed this manual process, please enter your MLS numbers with commas between them as in #####,#####,#####.************************************************************************************************** \u200b>>>Note: This works quite well, as many will send these in more than once, sometimes several a week. The system only puts a new email address into the auto-responder email campaign, so they only get this series once.Email #4 - Goes out 12 days after they hit the list.Future Reports & EmailAt the beginning, we informed you of this four email series, and this is the last. I hope that the information in reports and these emails has helped you in getting a better understanding of the Taos real estate market.Though there will be no more emails in this series, in fact no other automated emails, if you remain on our list, there will be a few emails every year all about statistics and market commentary. I'll send out, no more often than quarterly, Taos real estate market reports with MLS sold property statistics. This will help you to keep track of the market. Of course, please continue to visit the [brokerage name here] site. Also, you can pick up updated statistics at the stats page on the site.************************************************************************************************** \u200b>>>Note: I wind it up with telling them what's going to happen long term. I almost never get an unsubscribe if they get this far.That's the whole series!You can almost certainly find four valuable content pieces for emails to set up your auto-responder or drip email campaign. They shouldn't be too long, and each should give them something of value. You've promised them regular statistical emails, and you'll find that those emails will experience very high link clicks to get the reports. It's worked well for me."}
{"title": "What Happens If I Don't Pay Cash Advances?", "text": "Sudden financial difficulties can strike anyone at any time which can create an immediate need for cash. A cash advance is a short-term loan or a cash withdrawal made with a credit card that enables a borrower to access money quickly. Short-term cash advance loans are also known as payday loans. Failing to pay back short-term loans or credit card cash advances can lead to many negative consequences.\n\nInterest Accrual\n\nOne detrimental impact of failing to pay back cash advances promptly is that interest will accrue on the amount you owe over time. The interest rates charged on cash advances tend to be extremely high, so if you fail to pay a cash advance for a few months, the amount you owe could increase rapidly. Cash advances made with credit cards often have higher interest rates than normal credit card transactions and interest may accrue immediately after making an advance.\n\nFees and Penalties\n\nAnother consequence of failing to pay cash advances is that the lender will likely add various fees and penalties to your account. Every time you miss a payment you will probably incur a late-payment fee. The combination of interest accrual and fees can result in a rapid increase in the amount you owe, making it very costly to get out of debt later.\n\nDebt Collection\n\nIf you fail to make payments on cash advances long enough, your lender might hire debt collectors to try to get you to pay your debts. You might get mail or phone calls from collectors requesting payment and collectors might file a lawsuit against you to force you to pay. A court judgment could result in wage garnishment, meaning your employer would be required to send a portion of your income to your lender to pay back your cash advances.\n\nConsiderations\n\nSince balances owed on cash advances can increase extremely rapidly, the Federal Trade Commission recommends that consumers consider alternatives like a small loan from a credit union before taking out a cash advance. High levels of debt can lead to bankruptcy; bankruptcy has a severe and long-lasting negative impact on credit, which can make it difficult to borrow in the future."}
{"title": "Why pay extra toward mortgage principal?", "text": "mortgage\nWhy pay extra toward mortgage principal?\nDear Dr. Don,\nMy question deals with the wisdom of paying your mortgage principal early. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, with its associated amortization schedule, can't you achieve a significantly higher \"return\" by making additional principal payments at the top end of the amortization schedule? For example, say your mortgage payment is $1,000, comprising $100 toward the principal and $900 in interest. If you paid that $1,000, and then added another $100 toward next month's principal, wouldn't you save the $900 interest for next month? Thanks,\n-- Wendell Winnow iStock.com Dear Wendell,\nThere are many reasons why people pay off a mortgage early. They may want to be debt-free, for example. They may want the house paid off before retirement. From a strictly financial point of view, you will want to pay down or pay off the mortgage if you expect the after-tax returns on your investments to be less than the effective rate on your mortgage. The effective rate includes any realized tax benefits from the mortgage interest deduction. A mortgage with a stated rate of 4.5 percent might have an effective rate in the mid-3 percent range depending on your tax bracket and your ability to fully utilize the deduction. RATE SEARCH: Compare today's lowest mortgage rates Now, to your question: I'm not sure if you've thought that plan through. Your interest payments are based on your outstanding loan balance, not on your monthly principal payment. If you pay next month's principal payment, you will save a little interest, but not that much because your overall balance hasn't been reduced by that much. Difference in interest is small If the mortgage interest rate is 4.5 percent, a month's worth of interest on a $100 prepayment of principal is 37.5 cents. No pot of gold at the end of that rainbow. However, if you keep making additional principal payments every month, you can significantly reduce your interest payments over time. For example, if you pay an additional $100 to your principal every month, it'll reduce the interest and loan term as shown below. Pay down my mortgage? New mortgage New mortgage with additional principal payments Difference Loan amount New mortgage: $100,000 New mortgage with additional principal payments: $100,000 Interest rate New mortgage: 4.5% New mortgage with additional principal payments: 4.5% Loan term (months) New mortgage: 360 New mortgage with additional principal payments: 258 Difference: -102 Loan payment New mortgage: $506.69 New mortgage with additional principal payments: $506.69 Additional principal payment New mortgage: New mortgage with additional principal payments: $100.00 Total monthly mortgage payment New mortgage: $506.69 New mortgage with additional principal payments: $606.69 Difference: +$100.00 Total interest expense New mortgage: $82,406.71 New mortgage with additional principal payments: $56,028.95 Difference:-$26,377.76 The mortgage magic in prepaying your mortgage isn't in reducing intramonth interest expense. It comes from paying down your outstanding loan balance with additional principal payments.\nGet more news, money-saving tips and expert advice by signing up for a free Bankrate newsletter.

{"title": "How to Answer Questions About Not Being Promoted", "text": "Prospective employers will carefully review your employment history as they evaluate your application for a job.  They may wonder why your employer hasn't promoted you, especially if you are applying for a higher level job than your current position.If it appears that you were passed over for promotion, you should spend some time thinking through how best to address questions about not being promoted at your last company.At your interview, they will be trying to determine your strengths and weaknesses, and how they will affect your ability to do the job. You may be asked many different questions about yourself, requiring you to reflect on what kind of an employee you are.How to Answer Questions About Not Being Promoted at Your Previous JobHow can you present your background to an interviewer and convince them that you are now ready to take on a leadership position with their organization?Here are some tips for handling these types of questions:As you prepare for your interview, it\u2019s a good idea to make a list of the preferred and required credentials listed in the job posting. One by one, go through and come up with examples of how your experiences meet or exceed the requirements of the position. Be prepared to show how projects you have worked on, training you have received, and experience you have gained will allow you to excel at your desired job.Make sure you research the company, and review interview questions you might be asked, as well as questions to ask your interviewer. The more prepared you are, the more confident and self assured you will appear, which are some of the key traits they will be looking for in candidates to fill higher level positions.Best AnswersIt\u2019s fine to share any logical reasons why you didn't advance. For example, maybe long tenured, well respected colleagues occupied the only positions you were eligible to be promoted to, or perhaps budget cuts put promotions on hold.In other cases, you may have lacked the skills or credentials required by your current employer for promotion. This is a perfectly legitimate reason if the same qualifications are not required or preferred by your target employer.For example, perhaps your prior employer required a master's degree for the next level position and a master's degree is not a key qualification for your target job. It\u2019s possible that your years of experience have given you more in real life applications, which will allow you to bring a more grounded perspective to the position.In addition, if you have recently completed a degree or some training which upgrades your skills or credentials, then you should mention that as a reason why you are now better positioned for a higher level job.Mention Responsibilities and ProjectsAnother approach is to mention any added responsibility that your employer has granted you in your current role which is indicative of leadership ability. Perhaps you were named project manager or team leader for a major project or asked to join an advisory committee on a key organizational issue. You may have been asked to mentor or train junior staff and excelled in that role.When possible, get recommendations from past or current supervisors affirming that you were worthy of promotion and would likely have advanced if resources or open positions were available. References can also be tapped to assert that you could handle a higher level job and why they believe this to be true.Don't Criticize the CompanyWhatever approach you take, be sure not to criticize your supervisors or management. Fair or not, prospective employers will tend to side with your past employers and may consider you a complainer. Make sure that your comments are positive, or at least neutral, regardless of the circumstances at your current or previous company.You Are Not AloneMany times, even if you are doing a spectacular job, you will end up being passed by at promotion time. It may have absolutely nothing to do with your qualifications. It may simply be company policy to hire management externally.Sometimes the best way to get a promotion in the current business climate is to change companies. Hiring managers are aware of that, and as long as you can make a believable case for your qualifications, you should have every fair chance to ace the interview and get the job.More Job Interview Questions and AnswersInterview Questions and AnswersTypical job interview questions and sample answers.Interview Questions to AskQuestions for candidates for employment to ask the interviewer."}

What's the best way to handle an interview for a job promotion? What can you expect when you're interviewing with a company you already work at? How can you ace the interview and get promoted? What is a Job Promotion Interview?A job promotion interview is an interview for a promotion or a different job at your current employer. Many companies require internal candidates to go through a similar hiring process as external candidates for employment.A job promotion interview is different from a job interview for a new position for several reasons. First, you are already part of the company, and you know what their expectations are. Secondly, every day - before and after the interview - will give you an opportunity to show off your abilities while working in your current position.In addition, you can use your already established commitment to the company, and your aspirations to grow within it, to your benefit. On the flip side, you still need to go through an interview process and will be compared with other candidates for the job, possibly external as well as internal candidates. In fact, your interview may be tougher than candidates from outside the company, because expectations about what you know and your skills may be higher.Job Promotion Application RequirementsWhen applying for a promotion or a lateral job change within the company, employees are expected to apply and interview for the position per company guidelines. Even though you're already employed at the company, don't be surprised if you have to resubmit your resume and craft a cover letter for the new position. In fact, submitting a custom cover letter specific to the new position can be very helpful in landing the job.Remember, you may be competing with outside candidates, and although you have an advantage in that you already work for the company, that doesn't mean you should skimp on your job application efforts. Take the time to carefully review and proofread your application materials before you submit them.Tips to Successfully Interview for a Job PromotionHere are tips for acing a job promotion interview, so you can be prepared for an opportunity to move up the career ladder.Before the Job Promotion InterviewPay Attention to the Hiring Process. When you find out there is a job opportunity you're interested in, follow the application instructions. Don't expect to be able to bypass the company's hiring process to get the job. If the company has rules, they apply.Prepare for the Interview.  Review common interview questions and answers and consider how you would respond, based on your knowledge of the company, your current job and the new position, your skills, and your goals for the future. Review the skills you have that make you qualified for the new job. Also, review typical job promotion interview questions that you may be asked.Do Your Job Well.  Even though you may be moving on, continue to do your current job well, to remind your superiors about what a great employee you are.Tell Your Boss. If you get selected for an interview, tell your current supervisor so he or she doesn't hear the news from a third party. Explain why are applying and ask your boss for his or her support.Prepare For the Promotion. Prepare to pass your current job on to someone else; have all of your ducks in a row. If your goal is to continue moving up in the company, leaving a mess behind can reflect poorly on you. Offer to assist with training and to be available for questions.During the Job Promotion InterviewStay Professional. Even though you know the company and you may even know the interviewer, do not lose your professional attitude. It's important not to come across as too casual and relaxed. It's important to show the interviewer that you want the job, and have what it takes to succeed in the new role.Highlight your strengths.  Your strengths may include your familiarity with the position and the company, the success you have had in your current position, and the commitment you feel towards the company to make it as successful as possible.Remember You Don't Know Everything. Be prepared to talk about unfamiliar aspects of the position. Do not assume you already know the in's and out's. You may get caught off guard.Don't Be Over Confident. Do not go to the interview presuming that you \"got the job\" - an over confident attitude can be damaging.Ask Questions. If you have questions about the new position, what your role will be, and how you would transition, be sure to ask during the interview. Here are examples of questions to ask the interviewer.After the Job Promotion InterviewSay Thank You. Write a thank you note to the person that interviewed you. Reiterate your interest in the new position.Don't Burn Your Bridges. If you get the promotion, do not burn any bridges. You will be leaving co-workers behind, possibly becoming their superior, treat them with the same respect you did when you were working together. When the promotion is finalized, let your co-workers know that you are moving on. However, if the company is going to send an official announcement, wait until that is sent before sending a personal email message.Don't Have Hard Feelings. If you don't get the job, leave any negative feelings behind and work towards the next promotion opportunity.Suggested Reading: Job Promotion Interview Questions | How to Get a Promotion at Work"}
{"title": "Difference Between Pension Plans and IRA", "text": "A pension plan is a type of retirement plan typically offered by employers as an incentive to attract and keep workers. Pensions may be completely or partially funded by the employer but often involve combined employer and employee contributions. An individual retirement account, or IRA, is a specific type of retirement account usually established by an individual, although some IRAs may be handled through an employer. In many respects, the two types of accounts are similar, but some important differences exist as well.A defined benefits pension plan is one that offers a specific set of benefits to the pensioner. Benefits are typically based on how long the person was employed by a company and his annual earnings. Contributions may be made by the employer only, the employee only, or both. The employer guarantees the employee a certain payout, and the employer assumes the investment risk. Whether or not the investments go well, the employee will still receive the same level of pension income. Taxes are due on pension plans when the money is distributed to the retiree.Pensions established as defined contribution plans are those where the employee\u2019s retirement payout depends on how well the plan investments do. If the investments make money, the employee will end up with a larger amount of funds in retirement than he will if the investments perform poorly. The ultimate risk lies with the employee rather than the employer, and payout is not guaranteed. As with other pension plans, funds are protected from theft or mishandling by the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, commonly called ERISA.A traditional IRA is a retirement account that can be set up through an employer, but more often, it is set up independently outside of the workplace. Traditional IRAs may be entirely funded by the employee, although some plan types, such as SEP and SIMPLE IRAs, may include employer-matched funds. Money contributed to an IRA is not taxed until it is taken out of the account, when the account owner is often in a lower tax bracket. Both contributions and earnings are taxed at that time. Withdrawals before age 59 \u00bd are penalized with an additional 10% excise tax. The maximum annual contribution as of 2011 is $5,000, or $6,000 if the contributor is 50 or over.A Roth IRA is similar in some respects to a traditional IRA in that it is set up to be a source of retirement income. Penalties are assessed for early withdrawal. However, funds contributed to a Roth IRA are taxed prior to being deposited in the account, and qualified disbursements are tax-free. The contribution limits are the same as for a traditional IRA, but an income cap applies \u2013 single persons earning more than $107,000 a year and couples earning more than $169,000 are not permitted to contribute to a Roth IRA."}
{"title": "Car ads: What\u2019s fact and what\u2019s a fib", "text": "If you are car shopping, you probably can\u2019t help but notice car advertising from both manufacturers and dealers everywhere you turn \u2014 on television, in the Sunday paper, on the radio and online. The deals are everywhere, so much so that it\u2019s easy to wonder if they are too good to be true. The fact is car ads are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, and car ads often walk a fine line between what they can say and what they can\u2019t, leaving car shoppers to wonder what is real and what\u2019s a fib. Here are four common scenarios to keep in mind as you shop.\nThe special that doesn\u2019t exist. You see the specific car you\u2019ve been wanting advertised for a rock-bottom price, and you hurry to the dealership. FTC regulations require that the dealer offer at least one car at that price. The problem is, even if the car is there, it\u2019s most likely the least desirable version \u2014 the one that\u2019s a frightful color or is lacking in popular features most drivers can\u2019t live without.\nThe \u201cWe\u2019ll pay off your loan\u201d approach. Indeed, a dealer can pay off the car loan on your current vehicle if your trade-in is worth more than you owe. The problem with advertising it arises when consumers are misled into thinking they are no longer responsible for the car loan on their current auto when they owe more than the trade-in value. What the dealer is really offering with this advertising gimmick is to roll the negative equity from the buyer\u2019s current car into the new car loan, and that requires some very specific fine print in the car ads. In fact, the FTC recently went after five dealerships on this issue, and all the dealers involved agreed to stop running their car ads with misleading language.\nThe multiple-rebate scenario. It may look like you can get a cash-back rebate that takes thousands off the sale price of a new car, but in reality, that rebate is actually multiple rebates combined that you may not quality for. While there\u2019s the manufacturer cash, which everyone qualifies for, many automakers offer \u201cpersonal\u201d rebates, which are specific rebates related to the buyer, such as owners of the dealer\u2019s brand or of a competing brand. Others include rebates for recent college graduates, members of the military or other specific professions, or of a certain credit union. While this is a legal practice (as long as it\u2019s explained in the fine print) and some consumers can qualify for multiple bonuses, it\u2019s untrue for most buyers.\nThe \u201cWe\u2019ll buy your car sight-unseen\u201d strategy. High-quality used cars are in great demand, so some dealers, the huge AutoNation chain in particular, are taking a novel approach, offering to buy shoppers\u2019 current cars sight-unseen after owners submit a detailed description of their cars. The AutoNation program specifically targets owners with cars advertised on Autobytel.com, eBay and Edmunds.com that are located near an AutoNation store. While there are caveats \u2014 the AutoNation program requires the offer to be accepted within seven days or 700 additional miles on the car, whichever comes first, this is one advertising strategy that is the real deal.\nBankrate\u2019s content, including the guidance of its advice-and-expert columns and this website, is intended only to assist you with financial decisions.

{"title": "Room Rental Agreements", "text": "A room rental agreement is a lease contract between a landlord and a tenant. Renting a room is more limited than renting an apartment or a house, since a room often indicates that the tenant will be sharing other accommodations with the landlord or other renters. This can include sharing bathroom, kitchen and living room space. A room rental agreement is quite similar to any other property rental agreement, except for the descriptions and details of the space.\n\nProperty Description\n\nThe room rental agreement must indicate that it is a room being rented out to the tenant. It should specify the premises to rule out any misunderstandings in terms of apartment, housing or other rental property types. A basement is considered a room, so if the basement is being rented out, the agreement should state the premises as a room. The room rental agreement should also mention what state the room is located in. This is necessary due to the legal jurisdictions and rental laws that apply to each state or county.\n\nParties Information\n\nThe agreement should also list the personal information about the landlord and the room tenant. The contact information and current address of both parties should be listed as one of the first sections of the rental agreement. This is to indicate who is part of the rental agreement and provide contact information for each party should it be required at a later date.\n\nLease Period, Rental Feed and Specifications\n\nA common lease usually lasts a single year or operates on a month-to-month basis. The lease period should be clearly explained along with the lease options after one year of occupancy. The monthly rental fee along with down-payments or security deposits should also be addressed. The property specifications should also be included, such as smoking possibilities and included parking spaces if applicable. Although the room may not be furnished, the rest of the house may be. Rules and treatment of the furniture will be discussed in the agreement as well.\n\nProperty Tax and Insurances\n\nSome rental properties require the tenant to pay property taxes. This may be done by the landlord, but could be placed on the tenant. The tenant should be made aware of any property taxes or property insurance she must obtain before moving into the room.\n\nMaintenance\n\nSince the property may be shared with the landlord or with other renters, the agreement should indicate whether the tenant is responsible for maintaining the premises. Even though the tenant is only renting the room, she may be responsible for helping out with the property chores, such as shovel ling snow in the winter time and mowing the lawn in the summer. The final part of the lease agreement is the required signatures to legalize the contract."}

{"title": "When and How to Disclose Your Salary Requirements", "text": "Some job postings ask you to include your salary requirements, or even your salary history, when applying for the position. Employers request salary information for various reasons. If your salary requirement (or salary history) is too high, employers can screen you out because they don't want to pay that much, or because they think you won't be happy working for less money.On the other hand, if your salary requirement (or your salary history) is lower than the company is willing to pay, they may offer you a lower salary.To avoid being screened out, and to avoid being offered a low salary, you need to be careful how you describe your salary information.Read below for tips on how to provide this information without hurting your chances of getting a job, while still receiving a fair salary.What Are Salary Requirements?A salary requirement is the amount of compensation a person needs to accept a position. Some employers ask job candidates to give a salary requirement when they apply for a job.Salary requirements are based on several factors such as the industry, prior salary history, previous experience, and cost of living.Occasionally, an employer might ask you to include your salary history instead of (or along with) your salary requirements. A salary history is a document that lists your past earnings. The document typically includes the name of each company you worked for, your job title, salary, and benefits package.Salary Requirements: Include or Leave Out?First of all, if the job listing doesn't mention it, don't offer any salary information at all. Ideally, you want the prospective employer to bring up the topic of compensation first.If you are asked to include salary requirements with your application, you could ignore the request, but that means you risk not getting an interview. There is nothing employers like less than when candidates do not follow directions.It is best to follow instructions; however, there are a few ways you can provide required information while limiting your risk of being screened out or offered a low salary.Tips for Including Salary RequirementsWhen asked to include salary requirements, you can include a salary range rather than a specific amount. This range should be based on the salary research you've done. For example, you can state in your cover letter, \u201cMy salary requirement is in the $35,000 - $45,000 range.\u201d This kind of answer gives you some flexibility, and prevents you from locking yourself into a low salary (or being screened out for having too high of a salary).When stating a salary range, make sure that the range is realistic. Do this by carefully researching what the position is worth. Use salary surveys to determine the average salary for the position you are interviewing for, or for a similar position if you can't find information on the exact job title. Use salary calculators to factor in cost-of-living expenses and to estimate what you should be paid in a particular location. There are a variety of salary surveys and calculators, including industry-specific and geographic resources, available online.Another option is to state that your salary requirements are negotiable based on the position and the overall compensation package, including benefits.Either way, note that your salary requirements are flexible. That may help keep you in the running for the position and will give you some flexibility when negotiating compensation later on if you get a job offer.Tips for Including Salary HistoryIf you are asked to include your salary history, you can also list your previous salaries as ranges rather than specific amounts. But again, always follow any specific instructions about how to include salary history.If the employer gives specific instructions of how to include salary requirements, follow those rules. For example, if he or she says to give a specific dollar amount (rather than a range), do so. Again, you want to follow all directions on the job listing.No matter how you include your salary history, always be honest. It's easy for potential employers to check your salary with previous employers. Any false information will get you screened out of the application process.Where and How to Include Salary InformationSalary requirements can be included in your cover letter with sentences such as \"My salary requirement is negotiable based upon the job responsibilities and the total compensation package,\" or \"My salary requirement is in the $25,000 - $35,000+ range.\"Keep your reference to salary requirements brief, so the employer can focus on the rest of your cover letter.If the employer asks you to include your salary requirement in a different way (for example, in your resume), be sure to do so.There are a few ways you can include your salary history. First, you can include the history in your cover letter, briefly stating what you earn now. For example, you might say, \u201cI currently earn in the mid-forties.\u201d You can also include an itemized list of your previous salaries (or salary ranges), either in your resume or on a separate salary history page that you enclose with your resume and cover letter.Related Articles: Salary Negotiation Strategies | How to Answer Interview Questions About Your Salary Expectations | Providing Salary History"}
{"title": "5 Easy Steps to DIY Survey Respondent Panels", "text": "The convenience and speed of  online surveys research come with a number of important challenges that market researchers must be prepared to address. A fundamental consideration with surveys research that is conducted in digital environments is the absence of a connection (beyond the necessary electronic connection) between the market researcher and the survey respondent. While  market research that is conducted face-to-face is certainly not without issues that center on data integrity, the anonymity of electronic environments can substantively increase those challenges.Each platform on which surveys research is conducted brings its own set of challenges. Market researchers must adhere to rigorous methods for  recruiting and selecting research respondents. Questionnaires and surveys must be constructed in such a way that they  approximate the affective and cognitive processes that consumers use when actually contemplating, researching, and executing purchase decisions.The right type and amount of incentives must be selected and dispatched in order to keep research respondents motivated and \u2013 importantly \u2013 that encourage the response behaviors that result in useful, reliable, and valid data.  Eliciting the desired set of survey-taking behaviors from research participants is not a simple matter, and it is worthy of considered thought and planning on the part of market researchers.How Honest Are Your Survey Respondents?A perennial concern at the beginning stage of surveys research is figuring out efficacious ways to identify, mitigate, or eliminate the influence that  dishonest respondents can have on the outcomes of surveys research.Here, we focus on what is known as front-end data integrity. Surveys research depends on recruitment processes that are not unlike those used by job recruiters, college admissions directors, and membership committees of fraternal organizations. In each of these situations, not everyone will be accepted, nor should everyone gain entry to the select groups.Considerations for Commercially Developed Respondent PanelsIf front-end data collection vulnerabilities are to be reduced, market research respondent panel must consist of  the right potential participants selected through disciplined, purposeful methods. If a market researcher accesses respondent panels by paying market research service providers, then it is safe to assume that many of the challenges regarding front-end data vulnerability have been addressed.Is It Worth the Money to Engage a Respondent Panel?However, it is wise,  when planning to work with commercial market research service providers, to consider that some firms have resorted to the  construction and management of large respondent panels as a demonstration of their expertise and quality. All too often, these immense respondent panels have been constructed by adding panel members from purchased email lists. In these instances, the resultant respondent panel is doomed to be of poorer quality, and the  vulnerability of front-end data will have been increased through these disreputable methods.It is not unusual for commercially available respondent panels to need supplementation or adjustments in order to adequately meet  the needs of particular surveys research. However, disclosure of those changes to the panel \u2013 whether additions, deletions, or substitutions \u2013 must offered and the rationale for the changes clearly explained to the market researchers who are purchasing access to the respondent panels.Considerations for Construction DIY Respondent PanelsBelow, examples of the methods used by market research service providers are listed along with some basic considerations and ideas for do-it-yourself market researchers who  face the challenge of conducting surveys research without expert help.Be Choosey  Gather detailed information about potential respondents during the recruitment and registration process. Consider carefully the specific focus of the surveys research in which participants will be engaged.Invite Best Fit Matches Resist the urge to pad the panel in advance of anticipated drop-outs. Email individual invitations to  only those respondent who precisely match the profiles of questionnaire respondents that have been established as part of the overall research plan.Follow-Up Be sure to do the necessary follow-up with respect to bounce-backs of emails. Ensure email addresses are added to white lists or safe lists so that they won\u2019t be caught in spam filters. Commercial market research service providers use third-party firms to certify that lists are safe and to monitor the email behavior of those answering invitations to participate in panelsCull the Herd Be sure to cut out or partition off those email addresses that are suspect or that have bounced back. There are two types of bounce-backs: (1) Soft bounce-backs are temporary and caused by mailboxes that are over capacity, and the like. (2) Hard bounce-backs are permanent and indicate that the host server is inactive or that the mailbox no longer exists. Soft bounce-back emails can be resent to recipients after pre-determined intervals in an attempt to establish a connection. Hard bounce-back emails should be removed from the respondent panel list so as not to contaminate future correspondence or to overstate the member count of a respondent panel.Don\u2019t Be Kept Waiting When no response is received after several email invitations to the same recipient (for emails that have apparently been received and no bounce-backs have occurred), then it is time delete those email addresses from the safe list.Cutting out the dead wood and refreshing the potential respondent database will help to avoid  non-respondent bias issues and ensure increased response rates from higher quality respondents."}
{"title": "Should I Use a Media Headhunter?", "text": "What is a Media Headhunter?Headhunters, as you might know, are people who help place employees at companies. A headhunter is, essentially, someone who works in human resources as a kind of free agent, finding people out in the workforce to fill certain positions. Media headhunters specialize in placing people in jobs in the media industry.How Can I Find a Media Headhunter?A media headhunter might find you but, more likely, you\u2019ll need to seek one out. (If you\u2019re more established in your media career the chances are greater that a media headhunter might seek you out for a senior level executive position.) But, if you\u2019re just starting out, you search online for media headhunters and post your resume on sites like RecruiterNetwork.com, which cater to headhunters.You\u2019ll probably want to work with someone who\u2019s local, so you can meet the headhunter in person, but you might be able to work with someone remotely. Generally, you want to find a media headhunter who has positions that appeal to you in the city or region you\u2019d like to be working in. (Often headhunters work with local employers, so keep that in mind.)The other way a media headhunter might find you is from an application you sent in response to an ad for a job. Occasionally companies will only hire through a headhunter, so you might wind up meeting with a headhunter by chance, before you meet with your potential employer.What Can a Media Headhunter Do For Me?Similar to a media careers counselor, a media headhunter can offer you advice on your job search and give you tips about your resume. But, unlike a career counselor -- who\u2019s trained to help you figure out what you want to do -- a media headhunter can actually locate jobs for you. The value of working with a media headhunter is that you\u2019ll have an additional person looking for a job for you, at no cost.How Should I Prepare For My First Meeting?You should treat your first meeting with a media headhunter as a job interview. While your meeting will be a bit more lax, you\u2019ll want to present yourself professionally, i.e. dress the part, and be prepared to answer the kind of questions you might be asked on a job interview.You want to impress headhunters because their reputations are based on the quality of the applicants they send to their clients. The more you impress media headhunters, the better your chances are of being recommended for the positions they\u2019re looking to fill."}

Unless there\u2019s obvious fraud (or another problem), banks are required to make a portion of your deposit available to you.A bank\u2019s funds availability policy, along with internal policies, details how soon you can use your money. In many cases, the first $200 from personal checks is available within one day, and the remainder is held for several days.It might be helpful to use two different categories to understand when you can spend money: Typical situations, when you have no reason to worry about a check that you deposited Suspicious situations, when you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t trust the check writerIn typical situations, you can use your bank\u2019s funds availability policy as a guideline. In many cases, 100% of the money will be available within two to three business days, which is often faster than your bank\u2019s hold policy allows.However, you are always responsible for deposits you make to your account. Even if your bank lets you walk away with cash, you might have to replace that money later if the check bounces.When does a Check Clear?The term \u201cclear\u201d can be confusing, and bank employees may tell you a check has cleared before it really has. The safest scenario is when money has been transferred from the check writer\u2019s bank to you your bank \u2013 there was enough money in the check, writer\u2019s account, and the check was not an obvious fake.A check has not necessarily cleared just because the money is available in your account. Federal law requires your bank to make the funds available to you within a certain amount of time (whether or not the funds have actually arrived from the other bank).When in DoubtSo what do you do about checks that you\u2019re suspicious of? The best advice is to avoid taking checks if you have any concerns about the payment (see below for tips and alternatives), but that\u2019s not always an option.30 days: when in doubt, waiting for 30 days is a good start. Most problems will arise within that timeframe \u2013 checks from fake accounts and empty accounts should bounce, and you won\u2019t be stuck with a debt to your bank. If the check is from a foreign bank, wait even longer. If there\u2019s a problem with the check, you\u2019ll hear about it within 30 days in most (but not all) cases.Are you 100% safe after the money hits your account or after 30 days? No, nothing in life is 100% safe. As just one example, an account holder can claim that a check was written from her account fraudulently \u2013 even though the funds were paid to your bank, the funds will be returned.The RisksYou\u2019re taking several risks any time you deposit a check to your account. Some of the risks are negligible, but others are significant.The biggest risk is that you\u2019ll spend money you don\u2019t really have. Again, your bank will let you use money from a deposit before the funds have actually been transferred to your bank. In other words, your bank assumes the check is good: you can take out cash, spend with your debit card, and pay bills online. Banks do this partly as a customer service gesture, and partly because they\u2019re required to.If the check does not clear for any reason, you\u2019ll need to reimburse your bank for the money you spent. That\u2019s a minor annoyance if you\u2019ve got plenty of money (you\u2019ll just have less of it), but it can be a serious problem if your account is running low. A reversed deposit can bring your account into the negative, which means all of your payments will bounce until you fix the problem. You won\u2019t be able to use your debit card for purchases, and any checks you\u2019ve written in the last few days will be returned.Whenever you deposit a check you\u2019re unsure of, be especially careful if it\u2019s a large check. Cashier\u2019s check scams work because of confusion about when checks clear, and there\u2019s often nothing you can do to get your money back.In addition to finding yourself in negative territory, you also risk paying hefty bank fees when you deposit a bad check. Your bank will charge a fee, and any checks that bounce because you have less money than you thought will also result in fees.Ask Your Bank for ConfirmationIt\u2019s a good idea to ask your bank whether or not a check has cleared, but this might not be as helpful as you\u2019d hope. Bank employees often assume you just want to know when you can spend money that\u2019s subject to a hold. They don\u2019t know exactly what your concerns are with a check, and sometimes they don\u2019t even know that checks can bounce long after they\u2019ve been deposited.Many customers have been told that a check \u201ccleared,\u201d only to find out later that the check was no good. If things go sour, it\u2019s not the bank\u2019s problem or the customer service representative\u2019s problem \u2013 it\u2019s your problem.If you want to find out if a check has cleared, explain your concerns to somebody at the bank. It\u2019s best to talk to somebody that you trust and know is competent. Speak to a manager or visit a branch in person to be sure that there is no confusion.Alternatives to ChecksIf you\u2019re worried about bouncing checks, request payment in different forms. The safest way to get paid is via wire transfer. The money will only show up if it really exists, and the transaction cannot be reversed. You can also ask for cashier\u2019s checks or money orders; just be aware that those documents are sometimes faked (so you can run into the same problems you\u2019d have with a bad check).You can also use newer forms of payment. Some payment networks such as PayPal allow you to receive funds from customers and friends. However, you should research whether or not those payments can be reversed, and under what circumstances. For example, Venmo scams are popular with online con artists who get their payments reversed."}
{"title": "Deciding to make music your full time job", "text": "Question: Should You Play Music Full Time?Note that the advice in this article is geared specifically towards musicians and does not address going full time in other music industry careers.Answer:Taking the plunge and deciding to play music full time is exciting - and terrifying. How do you know when the time is right? Will you be able to pay your bills while playing gigs? There are a lot of questions to consider.Of course, if you're ever REALLY going to make it as a musician, this is a step you're going to have to take someday. Some people might get lucky and walk straight from their day job into musical riches, but don't count on it working that way for you. Most likely, your decision to go full time in music is going to be a calculated gamble, and there's going to have to be a little bit of \"cross your fingers and hope for the best\" involved. That's reality.It's also the reality that you CAN make it as a full-time musician. You just need to plan carefully and honestly evaluate the situation. For our purposes here, let's assume that there is no label or big advance in place and that you are going to be making the move independently. Weigh up these factors before you make your decision:What Are You Priorities?:Realistically, going full time as a musician usually requires sacrifices, at least in the early stages. Are you willing to make them? In other words, for the sake of your music career, are you willing to skip some nights out to save some cash? Forgo a new pair of shoes? Maybe live with roommates to cut down on living expenses? Many people make a comfortable living at music - and many more people accept a lower standard of living than they might ideally like to have in order to devote time and cash to getting their careers off the ground. Are you willing to make those kinds of trades, in hopes of making it in music? If not, going full time might not be right for you.Remember that if you're not just making plans for yourself - say, if you have four other mouths to feed - that this isn't just a decision you're making for yourself. Is everyone else ready to pitch in and tow the line? You're going to need some support, both moral support and maybe even some financial support. This is the time to make sure your priorities are on the same page as your family's priorities. Things could get rocky otherwise.Are You Already Making Money At Music?:What kind of earning potential do you have as a musician? If you've never had a paying gig, you should dip your toes in the water a little bit as a part-time musician before you jump into full-time musician mode. Not only will you need a good cadre of contacts for booking gigs and such that you build up over time, you'll also need a realistic idea of how much money you get paid play. Which brings us to our next point...Can You Make Enough As a Musician In Your Town?:Not every town lends itself to supporting full-time musicians. What is the going rate for gigs in your area? Are there enough venues to keep you going? Touring is an option, of course, but in the absence of tour support and the ability to demand high guarantees for your show, touring is more likely to cost you money than cushion your bank account. You need to be within easy reach of enough music establishments to keep the ball rolling or you need to consider relocating to someplace more practical.You Know It's a Job, Right?:Becoming your own boss and becoming a full-time musicians sounds really great. Then, 560 hours of Judge Judy later, you realize you haven't actually accomplished much. Make no mistake about it - going full time as a musician is a full-time job like any other. In reality, you might even call it full-timeDo You Have a Financial Cushion?:Even if you have a steady flow of gigs coming in, there's likely to be an earning lag. Make sure you can manage your finances as you make the transition. Sure, it's not very fun, but here's what happens if you don't take this concern seriously: you quit your job that is letting your get some music time in, you spend a few months falling into debt, and then you frantically have to take any job you can to make up the shortfall - probably one that leaves you less time for music than you had to begin with. That's a drag. Be realistic about the timing so you don't end up one step back from where you started.OK, that's the harsh reality out of the way. Now the pep talk: this is a chance worth taking for many musicians. Much of what separates the people who do music full time from the people who don't is that the full timers finally just crossed their fingers and gave it a shot. Give yourself the best chance possible with careful planning, then when you're ready, cross your fingers and do the same.Get Help with Self Promotion:How to Self Promote Your MusicAlbum Press Release TemplateTour Press Release TemplateHow to Write a Band BioTour Your Audience into Fans"}

{"title": "Hulu&#39;s Worth Checking Out for the Free Movies and Awesome Player", "text": "Update 8/26/16 - Unfortunately, Hulu is no longer free. Here are some other free online movie websites where you can still enjoy free content.Hulu is a website that lets you watch free online movies, trailers, documentaries, and TV shows. Because it's supported by advertisements, there are plenty of films and TV shows that are freely available.Below are my thoughts on Hulu's movies, video quality, mobile app, and more.Hulu Has a Wide Variety of MoviesMany of Hulu's movies are watchable only if you pay and subscribe to a Hulu Plus account. These movies are identifiable by the small \"h+\" icon on the corner of the thumbnail. Don't worry if you don't want to shell out the money for a subscription, though, there are plenty of free movies you can enjoy.I like that free movies and TV shows are easily attainable by checking the Free box at the top of the screen. This will immediately remove all the videos that cost, which is a great way to find all the free films.Hulu's movies are categorized in several genres, such as Classics, Food, Sports, Kids, Music, Drama, Family, Horror & Suspense, Action & Adventure, Arts & Culture, Video Games, and Science Fiction.I like how easy it is to find movies because if you don't browse by genre, you can look through collections of movies that are similar to each other. These collections change often, but they are usually always helpful.You can also browse through Hulu's movies by the most popular ones and those that were most recently added. This applies to all of the movies on Hulu and also the ones within each genre.I also appreciate that subcategories are present in the genre sections. For example, movies in the Drama category are sectioned off as Romance, Mystery, Police Drama, Crime and Courtroom Drama, and Medical Drama, to name a few. This makes it really easy to find a specific type of movie.Video Quality on Hulu is on Par With DVDsThe movies and TV shows at Hulu can have their quality-adjusted between low, medium, and high. You can instead choose auto to have the quality adjusted in relation to your Internet connection speed.I like that the auto option is available because then you don't have to be aware of the streaming quality that works best with your network connection.However, of the few movies I tested out, it seemed that the quality was less than or equal to the quality of a DVD.Hulu's Player OptionsHulu has a useful button in its video player that lets you rewind 10 seconds with one click. This is extremely helpful if you need to see something you just missed without having to worry about using the progress bar.With that being said, Hulu's progress bar is extremely easy to use because as you move the mouse to a different location in the video, a thumbnail of that scene is shown so you know exactly where you're headed.You can also make a video full screen or use the lower lights option in the video player, which will darken the whole web page except for the film.Another option is to pop the video out into its own screen. This will open a new window with the film at the exact same progress that you're currently at. You can resize the new window however you like, which makes it more flexible than full-screen mode.Similar to Crackle, Hulu's closed caption options let you define the color, opacity, and size of the text that's displayed on the video. This comes into use if you need the text to pop out of the video. For example, if the majority of the scenes are dark, you can use a lighter text color for subtitles.Hulu's Advertisements are ReasonableHulu shows an advertisement in movies and TV shows when the film is first opened, and they're sometimes as long as a couple minutes seconds. There are also ads positioned all throughout a video. For example, a movie that's 2 1/2 hours long may have around nine advertisements, a 1 1/2 hour movie will likely have seven ads, and an episode of a TV show normally has four or five.Because you can skip forward through a Hulu movie or TV show, it means you can skip over advertisements. Fortunately, you can see where the ads are placed in the video by looking at the progress bar of the video for small white dots. If you skip over advertisements, it still plays immediately upon resuming the video.It feels like there are tons of ads in Hulu videos because multiple ones are shown back to back at every ad placement in the video. For instance, a 40-minute episode of a TV show that has five ads, will show a total of 2 minutes of advertisements each time ads appear, for a total of around 10 minutes of ads.When you think about it, 10-15 minutes of advertisements across a 40-45 minute video is about what you'll find if watching it on live TV, which I find acceptable.My Video Buffering Experience with HuluI tested out several TV shows and multiple movies on the highest quality and had zero buffering issues. Films didn't pause on me, and advertisements followed through as smoothly as videos.Due to my experience, if Hulu doesn't seem to run as quickly for you, I would blame it on either a slow computer/web browser, slow Internet connection, or a temporary hiccup on the Hulu website. Hulu's Mobile App Isn't FreeYou can actually download and install the Hulu mobile app for free, but you can't use it to watch free movies and TV shows. You must login to an account that's subscribed to Hulu Plus before you can watch any of the videos through the app.Fortunately, though, there are several other free movie streaming sites that do offer free mobile apps.Hulu: Final ThoughtsI think Hulu's website is very easy to work with. The menus and categories are easy to find and browse through to make locating free movies and TV shows very pleasant.I also like the video player options. Turning down the lights or opening a video in full screen helps create a theater-like experience.Unfortunately, you must create a Hulu account to even see any of the movies and TV shows. But it's quick and easy if you have a Facebook account because you can login that way, or build a new account from scratch using your email address.It's also too bad that Hulu's mobile app doesn't work for free accounts because it would be nice to be able to watch free films on the go.Learn More About Hulu"}

{"title": "How to Answer Job Interview Question About Evaluating Success", "text": "During a job interview, your interviewer might ask a question like, \"How do you evaluate success?\" A question like this gives your potential employer a sense of your work ethic, your goals, and your overall personality. It thus provides a super opportunity for you to demonstrate, through your answers and body language, the qualities that most employers are looking for \u2013 determination, motivation, drive, enthusiasm, and a shared collaborative vision. Focus on the JobIn your answer, you should be cognizant of the type of job you're applying for. Whereas a large corporation might place all their emphasis on the bottom line, a non-profit would measure success not in money but in social impact. A technology company might place a strong emphasis upon innovation in product development; an online media company emphasizes page views and SEO statistics.Do your research before the interview: browse the company's website, research their presence in the news and media, and see if you can find any information about their mission statement. Pay particular attention to corporate web pages with titles like \u201cOur Mission\u201d or \u201cAbout Us.\u201d This is the easiest and quickest way of learning how they themselves evaluate success; your goal should be to mirror their definition of success with your own statement. Here's how to research a company.Of course, you'll also want to include aspects of your own personality in your answers. If there's an area where your values overlap with the company's, then make sure to emphasize that in the interview.But, you also want to make sure you give a balanced answer, illustrating a dynamic focus on improving your own performance, furthering your company's mission, and making a positive impact overall. Ideally, you will be able to show the hiring committee that you share their vision and will be a powerful contributor towards its cultivation and fruition.Examples of the Best AnswersHere are some sample answers:\"I evaluate success in different ways. At work, it is meeting the goals set by my supervisors and my fellow workers. It is my understanding, from talking to other employees, that the GGR company is recognized for not only rewarding success but giving employees opportunity to grow as well. After work, I enjoy playing softball, so success on the field is catching the winning pop-up.\" \"For me, success is about doing my job well. I want to be recognized as someone who always does their best and tries their hardest to make my goals.\" \"I evaluate success based on not only my work, but the work of my team. In order for me to be considered successful, the team needs to achieve both our individual and our team goals.\" \"I evaluate success based on outcomes. It's not always the path you take to achieve success that matters. Rather, it's quantifiable results.\"\u201cI tend to view success incrementally. As someone who is invigorated by new, complex challenges, I never want to find myself in a situation where I feel like there is nothing left to learn or achieve. If, over the course of my employment, I can leave work each evening satisfied that I\u2019ve learned something new or useful, then this counts as success to me. \"To me, success is when I am performing well and satisfied with my position, knowing that my work is adding value to my company but also to my overall life and the lives of other people.\"\u201cFor me, success comes from knowing that I\u2019ve contributed in a significant way to finishing a challenging team project within established deadlines and quality standards.\u201d\u201cSuccess, for me, will always be about making a difference in other people\u2019s lives. If I know that at the end of the day my work has helped someone to find a job or feed their family or turn their life around, then I sleep well at night and wake up eager to start work all over again the next day.\u201d\u201cI want to be a change-maker \u2013 to know that, through both my own focused efforts and our team projects, our community will hear and respond to the messages we are sending by initiating much-needed social and / or policy reforms.\u201dIf you are able to go into your interview confident that your definition of success tallies well with that of your prospective employer, you\u2019ll have created a firm framework for a memorable and productive \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d with your interviewers.

{"title": "Francine Prose Shows What Writers Learn through Reading", "text": "The Bottom LineFrancine Prose's book Reading Like a Writer begins by making a case for close reading, explaining how she discovered its benefits through both writing and teaching. Subsequent chapters provide examples of the kinds of lessons writers might learn by reading, starting with \"Words\" and \"Sentences\" and continuing on to chapters such as \"Character\" and \"Details.\" The book closes with a few essays, including the modest \"Learning from Chekhov\" and \"Reading for Courage.\"ProsProse's arguments are accessible and thorough.The quality of her writing illustrates the very points she makes in her book. Reading Like a Writer offers writing instructors a complex approach to familiar writing rules.Both beginning writers and pros will find something of value here.ConsReaders with short attention spans may not enjoy this book, but would be missing the point.DescriptionProse argues for the value of learning to read (and write) word by word, sentence by sentence.Enjoy discovering new writers, both older and contemporary, through her examples.Prose reminds us that literature can show us \"how many rooms there are in the house of art.\"Guide Review - Reading Like a WriterReading Like a Writer teaches that writers must read not only for pleasure, but for \"an eye and a memory for which author happens to do which thing particularly well,\" so that when faced with a particular problem, you'll know where to turn. \"Let's say you are facing the challenges of populating a room with a large cast of characters all talking at once. Having read the ballroom scene in , or the wild party that winds through so many pages of William Gaddis's The Recognitions, you have sources to which you can go not just for inspiration but for technical assistance.\"As Prose notes, literature, as opposed to books on writing, has the advantage of showing writers what is possible rather than simply giving a list of rules. For instance, we all know the importance of using synonyms to prevent repetition, but by giving an example from Raymond Carver in which words are repeated for a specific purpose, she tells us that it's OK to break the rules and shows how that can be done effectively. (It is for this reason that I recommend this book for writing instructors.)Finally, unlike many books on the subject, Prose backs up her arguments with her own flawless writing. In Reading Like a Writer, I always felt myself in the hands of an accomplished teacher, writer, and thinker: someone who not only urges us to take more time with words, but shows how this patience pays off in elegant, accessible prose.Francine Prose is the author of twenty works of fiction. Her novel A Changed Man won the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, and Blue Angel was a finalist for the National Book Award. Her most recent works of nonfiction include the highly acclaimed Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife, and the New York Times bestseller Reading Like a Writer. The recipient of numerous grants and honors, including a Guggenheim and a Fulbright, a Director's Fellow at the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library, Prose is a former president of PEN American Center, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Her most recent book is Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932. She lives in New York City."}
{"title": "Top 10 Reasons for Getting Fired", "text": "There are many reasons that companies fire employees. Readers have shared a variety of reasons people were fired from their job, including for posting on Facebook, for having a bad attitude, and for stealing, just to mention a few.Unfortunately, for many fired workers, in most cases employers don't need a reason to fire you unless you are covered by a bargaining agreement or employment contract. It's called employment at will. Employment at will means that an employee can be terminated at any time without any reason and without notice.That said, most employers won't fire an employee without cause. Most firings are termination for cause, which means the employee is fired for a specific reason.

{"title": "The 2012 Politics Behind the Fiscal Cliff Fiasco", "text": "Negotiations to avoid the fiscal cliff dominated the news in 2012. The Republican-controlled House wanted spending cuts, while the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House focused on tax hikes. This bitter stalemate reflected a shift in political power that occurred after the 2012 Presidential election.The difficulty in reaching a compromise showed just how far both sides had dug into their ideology. While they tried to work things out, the uncertainty over the outcome slowed economic growth, keeping millions unemployed.Here's a timeline to follow exactly what happened while history was being made. The key players were Speaker of the House John Boehner (R), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D) and President Barack Obama (D).Over the CliffDuring the final days of the year, Congress did not find a solution. However, this was partly because many Republicans had signed a pledge that they could not vote for tax increases. Instead, they would find it much easier to vote for a tax decrease after the Bush tax cuts had officially expired. For these political reasons, it would be easier to find an agreement if the country slipped off the cliff for a few days or even a week. This wouldn't be disastrous, as any agreement would be retroactive.Some Taxes Would Increase, Regardless of Fiscal Cliff ResolutionMost people didn't realize that some tax increases weren't even part of the negotiations. First, even though Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare, they knew that horse had left the barn. The didn't opposed those taxes as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations. Although they campaigned on repealing Obamacare, they realize they don't have enough political capital to make this happen. As a result, those who make more than $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples) will be hit with extra taxes. First, they will pay an additional 0.9% Medicare hospital tax on income above the limit. Second, they will pay an additional 3.8% tax on the lessor of their investment income (dividends and capital gains) or wage income that is above the limit.Everyone will pay 2% more in payroll taxes. That's because the 2010 Obama tax cuts, including a 2% payroll tax cut, expires by 2013.Even if the fiscal cliff is averted, it's most likely that those receiving extended unemployment benefits will lose that additional source of income. That's because Obama has hinted he would be willing to give them up as part of a fiscal cliff plan.House Caucus Rejected Boehner's Plan BIn late December, Boehner lost support from his own party for a Plan \"B.\" This included a compromise to allow the Bush tax cuts to expire for incomes above $1 million. Many Republicans were worried that, if they voted for ANY tax increase, they would lose the mid-term elections in 2014. Stock market futures dropped more than 200 points on the news. Congress adjourned for the holidays, promising to find a solution before the end of the year. Fiscal Cliff Uncertainty Slowed Economic GrowthOn December 12, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the business community was OK with a higher tax rate IF the Federal government would cut entitlement spending. This showed that businesses were more relaxed about tax increases than many Tea Party Republicans. He went on to add that the economy would immediately leap to a 4% growth rate once the cliff was resolved. His prediction indicated just how much the uncertainty around the fiscal cliff was hurting the U.S. economy. Plan A - First Pass at a SolutionIn early December, the two parties were pretty close in some areas. For example, no one wanted sequestration. However, Obama included some stimulus spending, such as building roads, that he surely knew wouldn't get passed. This initial proposal left room for negotiation and compromise. The Two Sides Weren't That Far Apart -- Or Were They?On November 22, the leaders of the House and Senate met with President Obama, and it seemed a deal was imminent. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the talks went so well that he thought it would be done before Christmas. It seemed the two sides were more than willing to compromise -- the Democrats would cut a little more than they wanted, and the Republicans would allow a little more tax increases than they wanted. $1 Trillion in Business Investment Waited for ResolutionPresident Obama said his highest priority after winning the election was to work with Congress to resolve the fiscal cliff. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said that there businesses were sitting on more than $1 trillion in cash, waiting for Washington to sort it out. Once the uncertainty about tax rates was resolved, that money would be put to work, expanding companies and creating jobs. Stock Prices Fell After the 2012 Election to Avoid the CliffAfter the November election, the stock market dropped. That's because stockholders began taking profits to avoid the tax rate increases on capital gains and dividends from the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the imposition of Obamacare taxes.Without a fiscal cliff solution, businesses continued to cut back on growth and hiring. They didn't want to expand in the face of a potential recession. Furthermore, some business owners sold their companies in 2012, to avoid capital gains tax increases in 2013. Slowed Economic Growth in 2012Uncertainty about the fiscal cliff started slowing economic growth as early as May 2012. However, everyone knew that nothing would be done until after the election. The two candidates held widely different philosophies on the best way to reduce the debt. Obama favored raising taxes on the wealthy, and Romney favored reduction in non-defense spending. As the closely contested campaign raged on, business leaders waited. It Was UnnecessaryThe greatest irony about the fiscal cliff crisis was that is was all self-imposed. True, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was more than 100%, an unsustainable level. But for an economy as strong as the U.S., it wasn't an immediate threat. In fact, investors were more than happy to keep buying U.S. debt, keeping interest rates at 200-year lows.No, the debt crisis was created by a Congress that didn't understand economics. In 2012, the U.S. was barely in the expansion phase of the business cycle. That wasn't the time to worry about national debt. Instead, the best time to raise taxes OR cut spending is toward the end of the expansion phase, to prevent a bubble. If the Republicans had waited a year, and let the economy fully recover, they could have been heroes -- and economic experts to boot. As 2012 wound down, it looked increasingly like a solution would not be found. Even if the tax hikes and spending cuts were enacted, there was still time for the newly elected officials to negotiate a solution in January. It could be retroactive to January 1, avoiding the $600 billion impact on GDP."}

When you're talking tickets, timing is everything. Here's the rundown ...\nDeparture: First and foremost, you need to buy your ticket a good 14 days in advance to score a good price. To get the cheapest seats, before they sell out, buy a month or two in advance. But don't buy too early ... since most airlines don't start releasing cheaper seats until 3-4 months in advance for domestic flights and 4-5 months before international travel.\n[Rick Seaney, CEO of FareCompare.com talking] \"Most people are procrastinators. They book inside of 30 days of departure. In fact, most tickets are sold inside those days. If you think about it from an airlines perspective, they have to hold back these seats for high paying business travelers. They've got to have a lot of trust that those business travelers will come in the last 14 days. And so, you really need to be buying that ticket no later than 14 days before departure.\"\n[Continue voice of Kristin Arnold] Business Class: Become business minded when buying your ticket. More airline tickets are sold from 9 to 5 Monday through Friday ... so airlines offer their best prices when people are more actively shopping. Purchase volume is the highest on Tuesdays\u2026which makes it the cheapest day of the week to buy.\nTurbulence free Tuesday's: According to Farecompare.com, Tuesday is also one of cheapest days to fly ... along with Wednesday and Saturday ... because they are the slowest air travel days. The cheapest time to fly is usually the first flight out in the morning and the last flight out at night.\n[Rick Seaney talking on camera]\"If you at least take half your trip on those days, you get half the benefit. So, you know, leave on a Wednesday come back on a Sunday when you want to come back. Or leave on a Tuesday and come back on a Saturday. You'll end up saving a lot of money.\"\n[Continue voice of Kristin Arnold] Don't forget about the overnight \"red eye\" flights ... another cheap option as they are neither comfortable nor convenient.\nFlight data: Just like you use your computer to track ticket prices, so do the airlines. In fact, if an airline notices that cheap seat sales are picking up, they can instantly raise prices ... and drop them if sales are lagging. Since airfares can change all the time ... taking advantage of email alerts offered by a variety of travel websites and airlines can help you get the best airfare bargains.\nTAG: For more ways to save on travel, visit the Bankrate.com Frugal Vacation Travel Guide.

{"title": "What Are Different Steels Called? What Are They Used For?", "text": "Different types of steel are produced according to the mechanical and physical properties required for their application. Various grading systems are used to distinguish steels based on these properties, which include density, elasticity, melting point, thermal conductivity, strength, and hardness (among others). To make different steels, manufacturers vary the type and quantity of alloy metals, the production process, and the manner in which the steels are worked to produce particular products.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), steels can be broadly categorized into four groups based on their chemical compositions:Carbon SteelsAlloy SteelsStainless SteelsTool SteelsProperties of Carbon SteelsCarbon steels are alloys made from a combination of iron and carbon. By varying the percentage of carbon, it is possible to produce steel with a variety of different qualities. In general, the higher the carbon level the stronger and more brittle the steel.Low carbon steel is sometimes called \"wrought iron.\" It is easy to work and may be used for decorative products such as fencing or lamp posts. Medium carbon steel is very strong and is often used for large structures such as bridges. High carbon steel is used mainly for wires. Ultra high carbon steel, also called \"cast iron,\" is used for pots and other items. While it is a very hard steel, it is also quite brittle.Properties of Alloy SteelsAlloy steels are so named because they are made with a small percentage of one or more metals besides iron.  The addition of alloys changes the properties of steels. For example, steel made from iron, chromium, and nickel produces stainless steel. The addition of aluminum can make steel more uniform in appearance. Steel with added manganese becomes exceptionally hard and strong.Properties of Stainless SteelsStainless steels contain between 10-20% chromium, making the steel extremely resistant to corrosion (rusting). When a steel contains over 11% chromium, it is about 200 times more resistant to corrosion as steels that do not contain chromium. There are three groups of stainless steels:  Austenitic steels, which are very high in chromium, also contain small amounts of nickel and carbon. These are very commonly used for food processing and piping. They are valued, in part, because they are non-magnetic.Ferritic steels contain about 15% chromium but only trace amounts of carbon and metal alloys such as molybdenum, aluminum, or titanium. These steels are magnetic, very hard and strong, and can be strengthened further by cold working.Martensitic steels contain moderate amounts of chromium, nickel, and carbon, They are magnetic and heat-treatable. Martensitic steels are often used for cutting tools such as knives and surgical equipment.Properties of Tool SteelsTool steels are durable, heat resistant metals containing tungsten, molybdenum, cobalt, and vanadium. They are used, not surprisingly, to make tools such as drills. There are a variety of different types of tools steels, containing varying amounts of different alloy metals."}
{"title": "Ex-husband offers lousy IRA tax advice", "text": "Dear Dr. Don,\nMy ex-husband forwarded to me information about early withdrawals from an IRA, as the terms of our divorce decree mandate that he gives me $20,000 from his retirement account. He says he'll be penalized 35 percent (taxes plus a 10 percent fee).\nDoes that mean 45 percent off the top or some different configuration? He seems to think I have to take the hit on the 45 percent. I will be checking that out, as my $20,000 just became $11,000. Thank you kindly for your input.\n-- Concerned Kay\nDear Kay,\nNever take tax advice from your ex. Don't take a check from him for this money, either. Ideally, you can keep the money invested for your retirement by doing a direct transfer into an IRA rollover from his retirement account to your IRA account. If that's the case, there are no taxes due on the rollover.\nTaxes and penalties are due on distributions, not on a qualified rollover. Your ex-husband shouldn't be taking a distribution from his retirement account and then passing money on to you.\nYou need professional tax advice on handling the transfer of these assets. You may need legal advice, too, but a tax professional will help you meet your financial goals and manage your tax exposure and let you know whether you should talk to your lawyer.\nIt's likely that there was a qualified domestic relations order issued to force the distribution of assets from your ex-husband's retirement plan to your control.\nIf you can't afford to keep the money invested for your retirement in an IRA rollover account, taxes and penalties could be due when the money is distributed out of the account. A retirement plan will subject a distribution to mandatory withholding at 20 percent, and you may be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax if you are not 59\u00bd or older -- unless an exception applies to your situation. A properly executed qualified domestic relations order , or QDRO, should provide that exception.\nadvertisement\nBankrate wants to hear from you and encourages thoughtful and constructive comments.

{"title": "How to Calculate the Number of Shares in a Firm", "text": "There are two basic types of stock: common stock and preferred stock. When a company incorporates, it authorizes a certain number of shares of common and preferred stock. This is called authorized shares. There may be several kinds of common and preferred stock authorized, such as voting stock and non-voting stock, or class A and class B common stock. However, these types of stock do not exist in the real world until they are issued. They are only authorized, or approved, for issue and remain unissued until the board of directors of the company votes to issue new shares.Contact the transfer agent that handles the company's stock. The transfer agent can tell you how many shares are authorized, how many issued, how many outstanding, and the approximate number in float.Subtract the number of outstanding shares from the number of issued shares to find the approximate number of Treasury shares. These are shares a company keeps for itself, and is typically done through a share buyback or repurchase. The company can use its Treasury shares to give stock bonuses to its employees, or to use the shares to pay for purchases of plant and equipment, or to acquire other companies.Divide the number of publicly traded shares by the total number of shares issued to find the percentage of shares in float. Most investors look for a lower percentage of shares in float because that tends to support the stock price. A small float means any good news can cause the stock price to rise since the buying demand may be larger than the shares available in the market. Tips  Issued shares and outstanding shares are different from authorized shares, but they are issued out of the total authorized shares. New shares cannot be issued unless there are enough authorized shares available. Issued shares are transferred to the ownership of shareholders in exchange for cash, services or other considerations. Outstanding shares are all stock that remains in the hands of shareholders, not having been bought back by the corporation. A corporation can buy back and hold issued shares as Treasury stock, but that is not considered part of the outstanding shares.   Warnings  The number of issued shares in the hands of stockholders who are not company insiders is called a float. It is important because it represents shares that have potential to be sold, since company insiders don't trade their shares as frequently. In a proxy battle, it is an important number because the float represents shares that are not controlled by the company, so if 51 percent of the issued and outstanding shares are in float, the outside shareholders hold control over any vote of the stockholders and can remove management.

{"title": "Snapchat, Square Team on \u2018Snapcash\u2019 P2P Payment Function", "text": "Another player jumped into the mobile payments market the other day: Snapchat.\nThe ephemeral photo-sharing app now lets you send money to friends with Snapcash, a feature that works through the app\u2019s chat function. It was developed with Square, the San Francisco-based mobile payments company, which will process money sent through the service.\nTo start, users 18 and older enter their Visa or MasterCard debit card information in the app, where it\u2019s saved and used for transactions. To send your Snapchat friends money, type the dollar amount into a message\u2014for example, \u201c$20 for dinner.\u201d The app will recognize the dollar symbol and turn the yellow \u201csend\u201d button into a green Snapcash button. When you press the green button, your money will be directly transferred to your contact\u2019s debit card and processed in one or two business days.\nYou can send up to $250 a week, or upgrade to send up to $2,500. If you send more than $250 in a week, you\u2019ll be asked to enter your full name, birth date and Social Security number for verification. You can receive up to $1,000 over a 30-day period, and will also be prompted to give your personal information if more than that is sent to you. The service only works within the 50 U.S. states.\nWhether users will adopt the new feature remains to be seen, especially with a slew of other peer-to-peer payment platforms already established, including Venmo, Paypal and Square Cash. Mobile payments are expected to grow to a $142 billion industry in five years, according to Forrester Research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s questionable whether people who feel comfortable using Snapchat to send silly pictures to their friends will feel comfortable entering their debit card information,\u201d says Heidi Liebenguth, managing partner at Crone Consulting, which advises clients on mobile payments strategies.\nSkeptics took to Twitter to express doubts about Snapcash, including security concerns, almost as soon as the service was announced. Some cited an incident in which hackers made public thousands of private Snapchat photos last month.\n\u201cSoo a bunch of snaps get leaked and now they expect me to give them my bank info, no thanks #snapcash,\u201d Twitter user Alex George said. On its website, Snapchat said Oct. 14 that the hack breached a third-party site that stores images sent with the app and warned that users of such add-ons may put themselves at risk by giving out their personal information.\nThe possibility of Snapcash being used to charge for pornography sent over Snapchat raises other security concerns, says Richard Crone, Crone Consulting\u2019s founder. While pictures sent with the app display for no more than 10 seconds, delivering cash to the sender means providing your debit card information to Snapchat\u2014and that won\u2019t disappear.\n\u201cIf anything, Snapchat is the antithesis of safety and security and authentication,\u201d he says. \u201cSnapchat is expired, perishable, vulnerable communication. You don\u2019t want a funds transfer to be vulnerable.\u201d\nTo protect against fraud, users can opt to be prompted to enter their debit card security code, called a CVV number, with every transaction. Additionally, since Square Cash processes the payments, money sent through Snapcash undergoes Square\u2019s encrypted security process.\nKatie Baynes, spokeswoman for Square, calls Snapchat a \u201cnatural gathering place\u201d for discussing activities with friends that may call for money to change hands, such as buying concert tickets or party supplies. Snapcash will allow users to chip in \u201cdirectly from their conversation,\u201d she says."}

Because it's the temple where I keep my money. It's a sign of reverence for my finances and it reminds me to respect my money. I even took it a step further and bought a red wallet because red symbolizes prosperity in Feng Shui.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean go crazy. I don't need a $3,00 Celine bag. I'm just fine with my Kate Spade bag that I got 75% off during an online sale. Or my red DKNY wallet I got on sale on a trip to New York City years ago.\n\nCheck your balance every day\n\nAnother way to begin being mindful of your finances is to check your balance every day. Even something this simple can make a huge difference in the decisions you make.\n\nDigit, which is primarily a savings app, can help you do this. They'll text you your checking account balance each day.\n\nPractice gratitude for what you have\n\nIf you're in a funk over your finances, gratitude is the best attitude for helping you get over it.\n\nI practice gratitude for the money I have every day. I also practice gratitude whenever I get a client payment or new deals in my inbox. Heck, I say thanks even if I made $4 in affiliate sales on one product!\n\nPractice gratitude when paying your bills\n\nThis is something I learned from Kate Northrup and it's freaking life changing! Whenever I pay my bills, I practice gratitude for what services/products were provided and the fact that I have money to pay for them.\n\nThis helps with the anxiety we feel when we see money leave our bank accounts. It also helps when you're trying your best to pay down debt. This is way more productive than beating yourself up and actually helps you keep moving forward."}

Some years ago, when the market went down, my account went with it and it's taken me until now to just get the balance back up again. With today's market, the same could happen again.

Now in its fifth season, the show is inspired by her life and writing. She lives in San Francisco.\n\nI'd like to let you in on my favorite trick for making dining out both more fun and more affordable: Pass on the entrees in favor of the vastly more interesting, generally cheaper appetizers. If one doesn't seem like enough food, order two (it'll likely still be cheaper than one entree, and you get to have 2 dishes for dinner!). My strategy is usually one slightly naughty app -- maybe something fried or cheesy -- and one virtuous item, like a fresh green salad. While my dining companions get stuck with whatever full-on main course they decide on, I greatly enjoy having my own personal pupu platter of options. Which brings me to what I'm cooking this week.\n\nJust as I enjoy variety in restaurants, at home I often prefer a plate with a few little things on it over one big hunk of entree. So this week, I'm taking inspiration from my favorite dining out trick and focusing on snacks and appetizers, then rounding out the meal with a simple salad, roasted vegetable, or sliced crudit\u00e9.\n\nguacamole + deviled eggs = genius\n\ncredit: Gabi Moskowitz\n\nFirst up is my fabulous Guacamole Deviled Eggs, which combine 2 of my favorite snacks in one delicious, low-carb package. It may seem a little odd to have deviled eggs for dinner, but trust me on this one. These come together so easily and are so addictive, I am certain they'll promptly become a regular part of your rotation. Add a hearty kale salad, and you'll looking at a fabulously tasty and healthy meal that's on the table in under 30 minutes.\n\nhummus from scratch > store bought\n\ncredit: Gabi Moskowitz\n\nNext, I'm making a big batch of my ultra creamy dreamy homemade hummus. Please stop buying hummus. I know it's convenient and easy, but once you make it yourself from very cheap pantry ingredients, you will learn what I did: Homemade blows store-bought out of the water. Also, this recipe makes a whole lot of hummus, which means you can have a little with some pita, pickles, and salad for dinner, and save the rest for healthy snacking the rest of the week.\n\nsweet potato bacon bites: bet you can't eat just one!\n\ncredit: Gabi Moskowitz\n\nAnd of course, we gotta have something with bacon. These bacon-wrapped sweet potatoes are utterly addictive and go nicely with other roasted vegetables. I pop 'em in the oven per the directions with a tray of broccoli and/or cauliflower tossed with a touch of olive oil and some salt and pepper, and by the time they're done cooking, my whole dinner is ready. BTW: turkey bacon works well here if you're not so into pork.\n\ni don't care how committed to tortilla chips you are, you're going to love these nachos.\n\ncredit: Gabi Moskowitz\n\nAnd speaking of sweet potatoes AKA red garnet yams, let's talk about these easy one-pan nachos. While regular tortilla chip nachos might not be the best dinner, these guys, plus a salad, actually make a pretty compelling case for themselves. The key is to slice the sweet potatoes thinly enough so they get crispy when they bake. If you have a mandolin, this is a great time to use it.\n\npretty, easy, with endless variations\n\ncredit: Gabi Moskowitz\n\nMy favorite impressive yet crazy simple meal to make at home is definitely these spring rolls. In the recipe, I call for a simple vegetable filling, but you can add anything you can think of, from shrimp, to grilled chicken, to avocado, to pulled pork, to crispy tofu. I've even seen fresh fruit like mango and strawberries added to these. I love to serve them with my mind-blowingly good peanut sauce, but sweet chili sauce, sesame vinaigrette, or sriracha are all great with these. I like them with crunchy vinegar-dressed slaw, or alongside a cold veggie-based soup.\n\nI hope these meal ideas inspire you to bring the fun of appetizers for dinner into your kitchen!

{"title": "Extravagant Spending at Colleges and Universities", "text": "Consider this: in the last 30 years, college tuition has risen more than five times the rate of inflation. The current price tag for an undergraduate degree is staggering: University of Michigan is $50,000/year, University of Chicago is $60,000/year, Oberlin College is $57,00/year, Reed College is $55,000/year. Schools might be able to justify the cost if all that money were going toward improving the quality of the instruction their students receive. But as a recent article in The Economist points out, spending on instruction at universities has risen more slowly than any other category.\nSo we started wondering: how wealthy are universities, and what do they spend their money on?\nWell Endowed\nMany university endowments took a hit during the last year, but over 70 of them are still valued at over $1 billion. Here\u2019s the top ten:\nRank School Endowment 1 Harvard $31.7B 2 Yale $19.0B 3 University of Texas $17.1B 4 Princeton $17.1B 5 Stanford $16.5B 6 MIT $9.7B 7 University of Michigan $7.8B 8 Columbia $7.7B 9 Northwestern $7.1B 10 Texas A&M $7.0B\nTo help put that in perspective, only four universities in Europe have an endowment worth more than $1 billion, and the University of Cambridge (UK) tops the list at $4.3bn.\nWell Compensated\nIf you want to be a millionaire, lavishly entertain guests, and travel the world, then you should consider becoming a college or university president! At private institutions, the median presidential salary is about $400,000, and over 30 presidents made more than $1m. At public schools, presidents make slightly less, but E. Gordon Lee of Ohio State University tops the list with a total compensation package of $1.9m. In addition, the Dayton Daily News has discovered that the university spends about $23,000 per month for Lee to entertain guests at Pizzuti House, the 9,600-square-foot mansion where he lives alone (pictured above). The university furnished the mansion with artwork worth about $673,000, as well as a $572 shower curtain in the guest bathroom.\nWell Equipped\nTo attract new students and maintain their ranking, universities are spending increasing amounts of money on infrastructure and amenities. Alumni centers, luxurious dormitories, dining halls, student unions, recreational facilities\u2013in today\u2019s college market, these are the things that distinguish one school from its competitors. Universities see construction and development as a good long term investment, even if it means going into significant debt. NYU\u2019s debt, for instance, is currently $2.8bn. All that money could really help students who need financial aid. (NYU costs just shy of $60,000/year.)\nThese figures may be surprising, but they shouldn\u2019t be. Modern universities operate like major corporations, with high-paid CEOs, well-appointed campuses, and big expense accounts. MOOCs have the potential to change this model by educating students remotely and turning campus amenities into luxuries. But if they succeed, then enjoying those luxuries will be all that distinguishes attending Michigan or Oberlin from living at home with mom and dad."}

Credit scores are more like your driving record: They take into account years of past behavior, not just your present actions. FREE TOOL: Keep an eye on your credit score for free at myBankrate today. In addition to making the right moves, you also have to be consistent. A few easy steps can move your score in the right direction. 7 steps to raise your credit score Watch those credit card balances. Eliminate credit card balances. Leave old debt on your report. Use your calendar. Pay bills on time. Don't hint at risk. Don't obsess. 1. Watch those credit card balances One major factor in your credit score is how much revolving credit you have versus how much you're actually using. The smaller that percentage is, the better it is for your credit rating. The optimum: 30 percent or lower. To boost your score, \"pay down your balances, and keep those balances low,\" says Pamela Banks, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union. What you might not know: Even if you pay balances in full every month, you still could have a higher utilization ratio than you'd expect. That's because some issuers use the balance on your statement as the one reported to the bureau. Even if you're paying balances in full every month, your credit score will still weigh your monthly balances. One strategy: See if the credit card issuer will accept multiple payments throughout the month. RATE SEARCH: Shop today for the best credit cards from our partners. 2. Eliminate credit card balances \"A good way to improve your credit score is to eliminate nuisance balances,\" says John Ulzheimer, a nationally recognized credit expert formerly of FICO and Equifax. Those are the small balances you have on a number of credit cards. The reason this strategy can boost your score: One of the items your score considers is just how many of your cards have balances, says Ulzheimer. He says that's why charging $50 on one card and $30 on another instead of using the same card (preferably one with a good interest rate), can hurt your credit score.\nThe solution to improve your credit score is to gather up all those credit cards on which you have small balances and pay them off, Ulzheimer says. Then select one or two go-to cards that you can use for everything.\n\"That way, you're not polluting your credit report with a lot of balances,\" he says.\n3. Leave old debt on your report\nSome people erroneously believe that old debt on their credit report is bad, says Ulzheimer.\nThe minute they get their home or car paid off, they're on the phone trying to get it removed from their credit report, he says.\nNegative items are bad for your credit score, and most of them will disappear from your report after seven years. However, \"arguing to get old accounts off your credit report just because they're paid is a bad idea,\" he says.\nGood debt -- debt that you've handled well and paid as agreed -- is good for your credit. The longer your history of good debt is, the better it is for your score.\nOne of the ways to improve your credit score: Leave old debt and good accounts on as long as possible, says Ulzheimer. This is also a good reason not to close old accounts where you've had a solid repayment record.\nTrying to get rid of old good debt \"is like making straight A's in high school and trying to expunge the record 20 years later,\" Ulzheimer says. \"You never want that stuff to come off your history.\"\nNeed a trainer? The Bankrate Financial Fitness Center can help you get your credit on track.\n4. Use your calendar\nIf you're shopping for a home, car or student loan, it pays to do your rate shopping within a short time period.\nEvery time you apply for credit, it can cause a small dip in your credit score that lasts a year. That's because if someone is making multiple applications for credit, it usually means he or she wants to use more credit.\nHowever, with three kinds of loans -- mortgage, auto and more recently, student loans -- scoring formulas allow for the fact that you'll make multiple applications but take out only one loan.\nThe FICO score, a credit score commonly used by lenders, ignores any such inquiries made in the 30 days prior to scoring. If it finds some that are older than 30 days, it will count those made within a typical shopping period as just one inquiry.\nThe length of that shopping period depends on the credit score used.\nIf lenders are using the newest forms of scoring software, then you have 45 days, says Ulzheimer. With older forms, you need to keep it to 14 days.\nOlder forms of the software won't count multiple student loan inquiries as one, no matter how close together you make applications, he says.\n\"The takeaway is, don't dillydally,\" Ulzheimer says.\nFREE TOOL: Get your credit report and score today, free and with no obligation at myBankrate.\n5. Pay bills on time\nTrying to get rid of old good debt 'is like making straight A's in high school and trying to expunge the record 20 years later.'\nIf you're planning a major purchase (like a home or a car), you might be scrambling to assemble one big chunk of cash.\nWhile you're juggling bills, you don't want to start paying bills late. Even if you're sitting on a pile of savings, a drop in your score could scuttle that dream deal.\nOne of the biggest ingredients in a good credit score is simply month after month of plain-vanilla, on-time payments.\n\"Credit scores are determined by what's in your credit report,\" says Linda Sherry, director of national priorities for Consumer Action. If you're bad about paying your bills -- or paying them on time -- it damages your credit and hurts your credit score, she says.\nThat can even extend to items that aren't normally associated with credit reporting, such as library books, she says. That's because even if the original \"creditor,\" such as the library, doesn't report to the bureaus, they may eventually call in a collections agency for an unpaid bill. That agency could very well list the item on your credit report.\nSaving money for a major purchase is smart. Just don't slight the regular bills to do it.\n6. Don't hint at risk\nSometimes, one of the best ways to improve your credit score is to not do something that could sink it.\nTwo of the biggies are missing payments and suddenly paying less (or charging more) than you normally do, says Dave Jones, retired president of the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies.\nOther changes that could scare your card issuer (but not necessarily hurt your credit score): taking cash advances or even using your cards at businesses that could indicate current or future money stress, such as a pawnshop or a divorce attorney, he says.\n\"You just don't want to do anything that would indicate risk,\" says Jones.\nYou know about credit right? Test your knowledge.\n7. Don't obsess\nYou should be laser-focused on your credit score when you know you'll soon need credit. In the interim, pay your bills and use credit responsibly. Your score will reflect these smart spending behaviors.\nAre you getting ready to make a big purchase, such as a home or car? At least a few months in advance, spring for a copy of your credit scores, Consumer Action's Sherry says.\nWhile the score that you pay for may not be the exact same one your lender uses, it will grade you on many of the same criteria and give you a good indication of how well you're managing your credit, she says. It will provide you with specific ways to improve your credit score -- in the form of several codes or factors that kept your score from being higher.\nIf you are denied credit (or don't qualify for the lender's best rate), the lender has to show you the credit score it used, thanks to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nAnother smart move is to regularly keep up with your credit reports, says Sherry.\nYou're entitled to one of each of your three credit bureau reports (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) for free every 12 months through AnnualCreditReport.com.\nIt's smart to stagger them, Sherry says. Send for one every four months, and you can monitor your credit for free.\nFREE TOOL: Monitor your credit today for free! Check your credit report at myBankrate."}
{"title": "List of Home Amenities and Features for Home Buyers", "text": "Question: A Complete List of Home Amenities and Features for Home BuyersA reader asks: \"I'm a first-time home buyer, and when the time comes for my agent to ask me what I desire in a home, I won't know what to say besides simple things like a two-story home with a walkout in a quiet neighborhood. But there's much more to a home than that! Can you write a Complete List of Amenities or Features that I can use to let my agent know exactly what I'm looking for? Waterfront, fireplace, bonus rooms, etc. Many first-time home buyers would really appreciate that. Thank you. -- Linda.\"Answer: Home amenities and features are details with which I am intimately familiar, Linda. So, you have come to the right place for answers. One of the really great things about giving your agent a list of amenities and features is that your agent can utilize technology to find that perfect home for you from this list.Most MLS systems that agents use to find homes contain search parameters. Some will let you exclude certain types of criteria, which might be more helpful to you than you may first think. If, for example, you absolutely do not want to buy a home with carpeting, your agent can exclude all homes with carpeting from your search requirements.The more closely you define parameters, the fewer homes you may find that are available to you. If you include too many parameters, you may not find any homes at all. If is best to be more general and less specific. Plus, bear in mind that information exported is only as good as the information imported, and some agents might leave certain fields blank.Location, Location, LocationThis is the first rule of real estate. Location is the most important yet the most often overlooked rule. If you have to choose between a home with all of the amenities you want in a bad location or a home in a good location with only some of the amenities, choose the home with the good location.Narrow your list to your top 3 to 5 neighborhoods. Talk to the neighbors to find out if these areas are indeed where you might want to live. Let your agent know the ZIP codes you would like, or define the area by street boundaries so your agent can draw a map search.Types of LocationsView of Coastal, City or HillsWaterfront -- River, Ocean, LakefrontGreenbeltGolf CourseSuburbanCityRaised Elevation or MountainsCul De SacDead End StreetGated CommunityConstruction, Exterior, Style, Roof and Yard Amenities and FeaturesAs a child, I drew home layouts in the street with drywall chalk from new construction sites. My dream home back then looked like Cinderella's castle at Disneyland. We all have some idea of what our perfect home would look like.

If you do not want a newer home, you can ask your agent to limit your search to homes built prior to a certain year. Bear in mind that if your cutoff is homes built before 1970, you will not receive a home listing for a home built in 1971.Single Family -- Attached or Detached -- Duplex, Halfplex, Condo, Townhome, Manufactured HomeAge of Home / Year BuiltNumber of BedroomsNumber of BathsNumber of Stories or LevelsOrientation (direction home faces)Utilities -- Gas / ElectricHVAC -- Central Heating & Air Conditioning, Propane, Gravity, Floor or WallParking / GarageRV Parking or Boat StorageTypes of RoomsNumber of Masters / Junior Masters / EnsuitesLoftDenBonus RoomGreat RoomHome Office AreaHome TheaterMedia RoomFamily RoomGym / Workout RoomLibraryButler's PantrySun RoomDownstairs' BedroomBasementGuest QuartersWine StorageFlooringCarpetingConcreteBambooStoneTileLaminateCorkVinyl / LinoleumManufactured WoodMarbleWoodSpecific Home Amenities and FeaturesHome buyers often desire certain features in 4 areas of the home: the kitchen, master, baths, and dining room. In addition, I sometimes hear buyers state preferences for home energy features, including disability features.

{"title": "What Is a Health Insurance Waiver and How Does It Work?", "text": "What Is a Health Insurance Waiver?Definition: A health insurance waiver is a document that when signed provides the option to opt-out of a health insurance plan offered to you by way of a formal request and applies to health insurance group plan that you are being offered as part of a program, your employer, school or other organization. Health insurance waivers are not available in all circumstances and may have specific requirements to qualify. What Is a Health Insurance Waiver Form? How to Waive Health Insurance BenefitsA health insurance waiver form will usually contain information regarding your request to waive access to a health insurance plan being offered to you. The health insurance waiver form will include your declaration that you have been offered a plan, however have chosen to refuse the health insurance coverage being offered to you. Depending on the organization or reason for your health insurance waiver request, you may also be required to provide proof of the reason that you wish to waive health insurance benefits. This is for the protection of the organization, company or school that is offering you the plan. They may want to verify that you have adequate health insurance elsewhere before approving your health insurance waiver request. Health insurance waivers may have to be signed on an annual basis, and in the event that your situation changes, it may become part of your agreement that you advise your plan provider. Examples of When You Might Want to Request a Health Insurance WaiverWhen your employer health insurance plan or student health insurance plan is not required because you already have insurance through another plan. For example, if your spouse has a health insurance plan that already covers you, you might request a health insurance waiver because you do not need the coverage your school or employer is offering you since you are already insured elsewhere.If you have the opportunity to obtain better health insurance coverage elsewhere, either through an individually purchased plan or through a family member. You may be required to prove the alternate insurance coverage.If you are eligible for a plan that meets the Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC). MEC is any health insurance plan that meets the minimum requirement of the Affordable Care Act.If you are covered on your parents' health insurance planIf you are already covered or eligible for services through an Indian Health Services provider If you are a member of a religious sect with objections to insuranceHealth Insurance Waivers and College or University Health Insurance PlansAlthough employers do not offer health insurance waivers as much as they used to, universities tend to have health insurance waiver opportunities. Students enrolled in equal or better health insurance plans than the one offered by their college or university usually have the option to waive the health insurance by filling in a health insurance waiver form and providing proof of comparable coverage elsewhere. This is a popular option for students since they are often covered on a family plan, and the cost savings of waiving health insurance can amount to thousands of dollars a year.Health Insurance Waivers Through Your EmployerBecause of tough economic times, many companies are cutting back on health insurance waivers or eliminating them altogether. Health insurance waivers used to be popular among employers attracting employees. This was when companies offered health insurance benefits free to their employees.Now that most employees pay a portion of their health insurance and that companies are on a tighter budget, medical insurance waivers are not as common. The cost of medical insurance waivers is now hurting employers more than being a benefit to an employee.When Is a Health Insurance Waiver an Advantage?Some companies, usually local government employers, offer medical waivers as part of an employee benefit package. If an employee chooses a medical waiver they could receive an extra yearly payment that would be a percentage of what the company pays for the employee's insurance coverage. Some of these medical waiver benefits are as high as $7,000 per year.Medical or Health Insurance Benefit Waiver from Your EmployerEmployer-sponsored health insurance plans can be a significant advantage for employees, especially when the employer pays for part or all of the health insurance coverage. However, there are times when a person may not need the medical plan from their employer, for example, for an employee who lives in a household that already has a plan covering the family. In this case, one insurance plan may be all that is needed. Signing a Health Insurance Waiver as a Strategy to Save Money or Gain IncomeThe health Insurance waiver is sometimes viewed as an employee benefit because by waiving insurance, some employers have offered to compensate the employee for the financial value of the cost of insurance. Unfortunately, due to the economy many employers do not offer their employees fully paid insurance benefit packages, therefore the popularity of this type of employee benefit or perk is not as common as it once was when the economy was stronger and employers offered health insurance benefits for \"free.\" Signing a health insurance waiver may not provide any advantage in regard to your employee benefits in the form of a salary \"increase\" anymore since many employers do not pay for their employees' health insurance benefits like they used to. The waiver may instead reduce the costs of deductions from your payroll for your insurance since you will be covered under an alternate plan and not paying into the employer plan.Example: Jim and Tina both work. Jim chooses the health insurance waiver from his job since he is covered under Tina's employer-sponsored health insurance plan. In return, his employer gives him an additional $3,000 per year payment. Also Known As: opt-out, buybackWhat If You Waive Health Insurance Coverage But Your Circumstance Changes? Can You Still Enroll?Every health insurance policy s different, so you would have to check with your plan administrator to find out if you waive the health insurance, if you can re-apply or be added to a group benefits plan if your circumstance changes.Before Your Sign a Health Insurance Waiver, Make Sure You Fully Understand the Consequences of Your Opt-outCarefully read the waiver to make sure you understand what you are signing off on. A health insurance waiver usually applies to the person signing the waiver and their dependents, you can not pick and choose who will be covered or waived. Pay particular attention to any clauses which relate to changes of circumstance, like having a baby, or if your spouse changes employment, or your family plan changes unexpectedly.Your health insurance waiver may include a clause, for example, if your family situation changes, you gain a 30-day window to enroll due to your change of circumstance. Examples of Changes in Circumstance That Impact Health Insurance and ChoicesPregnancy, Adoption or BirthChange of spouse or parent's employment benefitsDeath of a dependent or spouseMarriage, legal separation or divorce Gain or loss of employment or loss of eligibility for coverage due to a reduction in hours or leave of absence or layoffsBeware: Waiver of Healthcare Coverage May Affect Eligibility to Plans Under the Affordable Health Care ActWaiving health care benefits may make you ineligible for subsidized healthcare under the Affordable Health Care Act.Making an Informed Decision Before You Waive Health Insurance CoverageThe decision to waive health care benefits from an employer or other organization is significant. You want to make sure you are protecting your best interests and analyzing all your insurance options to choose the best coverage. Be sure and review the specific details of how your employer-sponsored benefit plan would cover you, how much it would cost and what advantage if any you might get if you sign a health insurance waiver before you waive your right to the health insurance plan. Your HR department or student services department or health plan administrator would be in the best position to outline costs and benefits for you."}
{"title": "Binding arbitration can tie up consumers", "text": "Unhappy customers used to threaten, \"I'll see you in court!\" That won't work any more. These days, consumers are increasingly forced to resolve disputes via mandatory binding arbitration. Unfortunately, while many people now are covered by binding arbitration agreements, most don't know what they are, how they work, when they come into play or who will be deciding the fate of their complaints. Businesses love binding arbitration. For them it's a faster and cheaper way to settle disputes and a great way to generate debt collections. Consumer advocates aren't quite as happy about it. \"I think binding arbitration is bad for a number of reasons, chiefly because it guts the U.S. Constitution, which is the one document that makes our country unique,\" says David Rumley, an attorney with Wigington Rumley in Corpus Christi, Texas, who has worked on binding arbitration cases. \"Here, an ordinary person can take a big corporation to court and get a hearing in front of a jury of his or her peers. Binding arbitration, by contrast, is 100 percent in favor of big business and against the consumer.\"\nBinding arbitration Since it's very likely that you have signed up for at least one product or service that makes you subject to binding arbitration, you had better learn something about it.

How does binding arbitration work?\nWhat is binding arbitration?\nMandatory binding arbitration is an agreement to have a third party weigh the merits of each side of a dispute and render a decision. That decision is final, and in most cases it can't be appealed, either to another arbitrator or to a court of law. You give up your right to sue when you sign a contract containing a binding arbitration clause and you expose yourself to fees that can run into the thousands of dollars plus the cost of a lawyer. You lose many of the protections you would have in a court of law. The hearing could be in person or via a conference call. If the hearing is in person, it may be held in another state. If so, you'll have to pay your own expenses for travel and lodging while attending the hearing. If you hire a lawyer, you'll be paying his or her expenses, too. advertisement replacecontent-tcm:8-23994 While consumers can represent themselves in arbitration, just as they can represent themselves in court, it's probably a bad idea, as binding arbitration is usually a one-shot deal. If you make a procedural mistake or miss a deadline, the arbitrator may rule in the other party's favor and you will find it very difficult to appeal that decision."}
{"title": "How to Find a Lost Life Insurance Policy", "text": "If you can\u2019t find the life insurance policy of a deceased relative, you\u2019ve probably checked the obvious places \u2014 desk drawers, file cabinets, maybe even under the mattress.\nNow it\u2019s time to broaden the search. You\u2019ll need to locate the name of the company that issued the policy in order to make a life insurance claim. Here are ways to find it.\nUse a state policy locator service (if available)\nIn response to calls for easier ways to track down lost life insurance policies, some states have created centralized search services. Once you submit your paperwork, the following states will forward the information to all life insurers licensed there:\nThe insurers will search their records to see if any life insurance policies are in the name of the deceased. If so, the life insurance companies will contact you if you\u2019re the beneficiary or deceased person\u2019s legal representative or executor. If not, they\u2019ll work to find the beneficiary of the policy.\nMeanwhile, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is building a national policy locator app. The online tool features an interactive U.S. map. You click on the state and follow the instructions for submitting a search request. The tool, which the association says will be finished in the fall of 2016, will do one of the following:\nForward you to that state\u2019s policy locator service, if it has one.\nForward a form you complete online to that state\u2019s department of insurance.\nGive you a phone number for that state\u2019s department of insurance.\nThe state insurance department then will forward your search request to life insurance companies licensed to do business in that state. If a policy is found, then the insurer will contact you, as long as you\u2019re legally authorized to receive the information, or it will search for the policy\u2019s beneficiary.\nA few notes about these services: Generally you need to be an executor, a beneficiary or an immediate relative of the deceased person to perform a search. If you\u2019re just curious about whether your elderly neighbors left any life insurance to their no-good son, you\u2019re not eligible to do a search.\nThe searches will be helpful only if the policyholder bought the policy in that state. For example, if your relative bought a policy while living in Texas and then moved to New York, New York\u2019s search system won\u2019t help you. You\u2019ll need to use the Texas policy locator service. You\u2019ll typically need to provide basic information about the deceased, such as the dates of birth and death and a copy of the death certificate.\nDon\u2019t hold your breath, though: Searches aren\u2019t instant. The Texas Department of Insurance, for example, notes that it can take up to 90 days for insurers to respond.\nWait for the mail\nWatch for life insurance bills or statements in the deceased person\u2019s mail. Worst-case scenario: Your relative paid annually and just recently paid the last bill. In that case, you could be waiting almost a year for the next bill to arrive.\nDo a paperwork search\nLook for evidence of payment to a life insurance company in checkbook registers, canceled checks and credit card statements. If your relative had a permanent life insurance policy, check his or her tax returns. You\u2019re looking for interest income or interest expense for a life insurance policy.\nContact the employer\nAsk the benefits department at your relative\u2019s employer whether the relative had group life insurance through the workplace. Note that group life benefits generally end on the last day of work, so it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find existing life insurance policies through past employers.\nAsk financial advisors\nFinancial advisors are often licensed life insurance agents and may have sold your relative a policy or know of an existing policy.\nCheck with insurance agents\nYour relative may have mentioned life insurance to his or her auto or homeowners insurance agent \u2014 or even purchased a policy through the same insurer. It\u2019s worth a try.\nContact the bank\nFind out whether your relative kept a safe deposit box at the bank \u2014 and then check it for a policy. You\u2019ll need to be the estate executor to do this. In addition, ask the bank if your relative purchased life insurance through the bank.\nTry the MIB Group\nThe MIB Group maintains a database of life insurance application information going back to 1996. Insurance companies use the database to exchange information among themselves about customers. If your relative applied for individual life insurance after 1995, MIB probably has a record. While MIB won\u2019t know whether your relative ended up buying the policy, knowing where he or she applied is a significant lead. MIB\u2019s Policy Locator Service costs $75, and the company reports that almost 30% of searches turn up information.\nCheck with unclaimed property programs\nIf a life insurance company knows a customer is deceased but can\u2019t find the beneficiaries, it will eventually turn the money over to the state\u2019s unclaimed property program. The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators has links to all state programs. If your relative\u2019s death was recent, though, the benefit money won\u2019t have been identified as unclaimed property yet.\nOnce you know the company name \u2026\nAll you really need to find is the company name. You don\u2019t need a copy of the policy or a policy number to make a claim if you\u2019re the beneficiary. Once you know the company, contact the insurer for its claim paperwork, and be ready to provide the death certificate. You should have your money in a couple of weeks.\nAvoid the problem yourself\nCould all your searching and frustration have been avoided? Yes \u2014 for each \u201clost\u201d life insurance policy, a few simple words can spare months of searching. Tell family members the name of your life insurance company.\nAmy Danise is an editor covering insurance for NerdWallet. Follow her on Twitter @AmyDanise and on Google+.\nImage via iStock."}
{"title": "What If My Spouse Stole My Identity?", "text": "Identity theft is a difficult thing to deal with, but it can be especially hard if you find that your spouse has opened accounts in your name without your permission. This is one of the ways that a partner can commit financial infidelity, and it can have a long lasting effect on your credit score and your relationship. The way you handle this will likely depend on how you want your relationship to work out in the future. The laws surrounding debt during a divorce will also affect how much of this debt you will be ultimately responsible for paying off. These laws are state laws and you may want to speak to an attorney about what your responsibilities are before deciding a course of action. If you are in a community property law state, you may still be responsible for those debts.Freeze Your Credit ReportThe first step you need to do is to place a freeze on your credit report. This will let lenders know that you do not want anyone to open any additional accounts in your name. You can make a note about this including your spouse on the freeze. Additionally, you should pull your reports to make sure that there are not other unexpected accounts that you know about. The credit freeze can prevent your spouse from opening the accounts. The freeze may cost a fee, and the freeze is not one hundred percent foolproof. It is more effective to have a fraud alert put on your report, but you will need an official identity theft report, which means you must file charges.Decide If You Are Going to Stay in the RelationshipIn order to have the debt written off because your identity was stolen you will need to press charges against your spouse for identity theft. If you are trying to make things work in your relationship, then you may not want to do this option, and treat this as debt that your partner took out in his name without telling you. This means that you work together on paying it off. If you are choosing this option, you may want to see a counselor that can help you work through the issues of broken trust and work to repair the relationship. It can be very difficult to recover from financial infidelity, and counseling is one step in that direction. If you do decide to stay, you should determine a point where it is too much and you should end the relationship if it continues to happen. If you do not decide to stay in the relationship, you need to take steps immediately t o protect your future income and the assets tha tyou have by transferring things into your name, and closing joint accounts. Change the Way You Manage Your Money It is important that you establish a way to rebuild trust in the relationship and that allows you to protect yourself and your finances in the future. This often means that you split finances for a short period of time and move to a household budget to handle shared expenses. This means that you will need to open up a checking account in your name only so that you can separate your income from your spouse's income. You will need to have regular accountability meetings and talk about goals that need to be reached in order to reestablish trust and to merge finances again.Additionally, you should determine how the debts will be dealt with if you do decide to stay together. This process usually works better if you use a counselor to help you sort out the expectations and feelings. Regular budget meetings can also help catch small problems before they become larger ones. Determine if You Are Going to Press ChargesAfter this happens, you may decide that you do not want the relationship to continue. In this case, you should press charges for identity theft and take the steps to have this debt taken off of your credit report entirely. The credit card company will have to go after your spouse to take care of the debt. When you are filing for divorce be sure that you have attorney address this issue in court and in the settlement so that you are covered completely. It can take some time to clear this up and you need to be patient as you work through the issues.Monitor Your CreditIn the future you need to continue to monitor your credit. You can have a free credit report from each of the major credit bureaus each year, if you check a different one every four months, you can monitor your credit for free throughout the year. If you are concerned that this will happen again, you may want to consider signing up for identity theft protection. This service will monitor your credit for you and help you resolve the issues. However, it does have a monthly fee that you will need to pay. You may decide it is worth it if you continue to have deal with the issue in the future."}

Paying a late fee means you won\u2019t get reported to the credit bureaus.\nIf you slip up and pay a bill late, getting hit with a late fee probably seems like punishment enough. After all, forking over an extra $25-$35 for your forgetfulness feels like a sufficient slap on the wrist.\nBut if your payment is more than 30 days overdue, you should expect a negative mark to land on your credit reports, regardless of whether or not you\u2019ve coughed up a late fee. This one-two punch is a good reason to prioritize paying on time \u2013 if you don\u2019t, it could be costly in a number of ways.\n2. Your credit utilization ratio is 0% if you pay your balance in full each month.\nPaying off your credit card in full each month is a good habit to get into. But as you\u2019re patting yourself on the back for avoiding interest charges, don\u2019t forget to remain diligent about keeping track of your credit utilization ratio.\nHere\u2019s why: Your credit card issuer could send a balance report to the credit bureaus at any time during the month \u2013 not necessarily right after you\u2019ve paid your bill. Consequently, keeping your balance below 30% of your available credit on all your cards throughout the month is key to maintaining a solid score.\n3. All of your monthly bill payments are being reported to the credit bureaus.\nPersonal finance experts commonly recommend that we pay all of our bills on time. This is certainly important for avoiding late fees (see above), but it causes many people to assume that all of their bill payments are being reported to the credit bureaus.\nThis usually isn\u2019t the case. Rent and utility payments are typically not reported unless you become seriously delinquent; in other words, paying on time doesn\u2019t add any additional positive information to your credit reports. You still should, but understand that these payments generally won\u2019t give your score a boost.\n4. Avoiding credit cards will help your credit score.\nIn an effort to avoid getting into debt, some people choose to forgo credit cards altogether. While it\u2019s true that maxing out a card will do damage to your credit score, avoiding plastic entirely usually isn\u2019t a good idea, either.\nGetting a credit card as soon as you can and using it responsibly (which means paying your bill on time and in full every month) is one of the easiest ways to start establishing a solid credit profile. Eschewing plastic represents a huge missed opportunity, and the longer you go without establishing credit, the harder it will be to do so.\nThe takeaway? Using a credit card to build your credit doesn\u2019t have to result in debt if you make a budget and track your spending carefully. Usually, the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks.\n5. A bankruptcy will affect your credit for the rest of your life.\nIt\u2019s true: Declaring personal bankruptcy will have a serious, negative impact on your credit. But don\u2019t let Internet rumors or sensational media reports warp your thinking \u2013 a bankruptcy won\u2019t trash your credit for life.\nIn most cases, a bankruptcy will stay on your credit reports for 10 years, and the effect of this event on your credit score will lessen over time. This is not to say that you should treat bankruptcy lightly, but it\u2019s important to know that no negative mark has to affect your credit forever. By letting some time pass and cleaning up your credit habits, there\u2019s always a way to bounce back.\n\u00bb MORE: Why nearly every purchase should be on a credit card\nAssuming man image via Shutterstock"}
{"title": "What to do with your tax refund", "text": "Tax season is just around the corner ... while splurging on a vacation or new pair of shoes is tempting ... here are some tips on what could be the better option for you in the long run.\nGreg McBride, CFA, senior financial analyst, Bankrate.com\n\"Because the tax refund is the biggest windfall that many people get all year long there's certainly the temptation to go out and spend it and unfortunately this windfall that you get is really something that could be put to better use, using that to make some financial headway.\"\nTo make this financial headway you can pay down high cost debt such as credit cards. The more you pay off now the less you have to worry about next month.\nIf you don't have any debt ... instead you can pad that much needed emergency savings fund for a rainy day.\nOr increase your retirement contributions. By tucking your refund away you won't be tempted to spend the money in other ways.\nAlthough these tips may seem routine ... they are the best option for your well-being today and the economies well-being tomorrow.\n\"When people save or pay down debt, in the short term that's a negative for the economy, because our economy is powered 70% by consumer spending, but in the long run, we're all better off if American consumers have less debt and more savings. So we're going to have to take some pain now in order to have some gain later.\"\nAfter considering these tips, Bankrate.com was interested to see what people like yourselves would be doing with their tax returns ...\n\"I will probably be paying down some debt. I definitely accumulated some debt over the last few years and this will be a great way to reduce some. I expect a sizeable refund so I think I'll probably put almost all of it if not all of it, back to help get me back on my feet.\"\n\"That's tough because I'm an intern, I don't have to pay taxes.\"\n\"Well if I were getting money back I'd probably save it or spend it on bills but since it looks like I'll be paying more into the income tax, I won't have any coming back.\"\n\"Travel\"\n\"Save it for sure.\"\nFor more information on taxes just go to Bankrate.com under the taxes tab.

{"title": "Celebrity Endorsement Hits and Misses for Retail and Restaurant Chains", "text": "When Jared Fogle, the longtime spokesperson who single-handedly helped create a \"healthy fast food\" brand image for the Subway restaurant chain, pleaded guilty to child pornography charges and traveling across state lines to have sex with teenage girls, the precarious nature of celebrity endorsements in the U.S. retail industry was reinforced.When the image of a celebrity matches the image of a retail company, chain or restaurant, like it seemingly did with Fogle and Subway, the endorsement can be a hit on both sides of the advertising equation.  But the Subway spokesperson scandal illustrated clearly that even a longtime celebrity endorsement hit can quickly become a miss when the image of the endorser or the endorsed goes amiss.Retail companies, restaurants and chains are generally less likely to choose a celebrity endorsement strategy as a brand-building strategy compared to individual product marketing campaigns which often take use a celebrity-centered endorsement strategy.  The reason is because while promotions for the latest and greatest products come and go, retail companies, stores, and restaurant chains endure.Even though Subway hopes that its customers forgive and forget its association with Jared, the Subway brand image will be at least a little bit tainted until entire generations of Subway commercial viewers lose their long-term memory about the shocking revelation that an \"all-American\" restaurant chain built its business using a spokesperson who was allegedly using his Subway celebrity to victimize children in a most unappetizing way.What follows is a comprehensive list of famous sports, music, television, and movie stars who have endorsed US retailers in the 20th and 21st century television, print, radio, and online advertising campaigns. Viewing the list of celebrity endorsers for each company reveals the type of brand image the retailer was attempting to cultivate, and the customer demographics it was attempting to appeal to.This list is arranged alphabetically, according to the name of the retail company.

{"title": "Guidelines for Employer Social Media Site Checks", "text": "With everyone's social information showing up just about everywhere online, it's important to be aware of what you should, and shouldn't, do when it comes to social networking. Keep Your Personal Info PrivateMore job seekers are diversifying their presence on social media and are separating personal from professional activity.  Candidates have become savvier about applying privacy controls to their personally oriented social networking accounts. Younger candidates, in particular, are spending more time on sites like Twitter and Instagram and less time on Facebook.  Make Your Professional Info PublicGiven these trends, it makes more sense for employers to focus on professionally oriented sites with their social media checks. Candidates should still monitor their presence on personally oriented sites and restrict access to non-friends. However, you should make an extra effort to build a strong professional presence on LinkedIn and/or a personal website.  Employers will often find it more fruitful to examine the LinkedIn profile for candidates and review information like recommendations, endorsements, and portfolio samples.What Companies CheckIt is important to be aware of the rules companies should be following when it comes to checking out job applicants on social networking sites. Even though not all companies have policies on what and how they check, many do.From the employer perspective, it's important to have guidelines in place when conducting social networking research. That way there is a standard protocol that applies to all candidates, and there are no potential discrimination issues.Tips for Conducting a Social Networking CheckHere's what companies ought to know, and what job applicants should be aware of, about conducting employer social networking checks for candidates for employment from Jay Zweig, Partner, Bryan Cave LLP. Be consistent. Use social networking research to screen all job applicants for all positions or do not use it at all.  Tell applicants in advance that you will be looking online and at social media sites as part of the application process.  Designate someone who is not the ultimate decision maker as the social media researcher to help ensure the decision maker does not know about legally protected information.  Decide what information about applicants it is that you are looking for online and provide your social media researcher with specific instruction on reporting back this information only.  Do not access any applicants' social media profile or web page through dishonest or deceptive means.  Consider the accuracy and validity of the information before making a decision.Related Articles and AdviceSocial Networking TipsEmployee Background ChecksWhat Companies Can Legally CheckEmployee Privacy"}
{"title": "What Is Landlocked Property Worth?", "text": "Landlocked property is not desirable for property owners because its use is limited. Cities or counties may inadvertently create landlocked property when a new highway is built with no entry or exit alongside a piece of property, such as farmland. Some possible remedies exist, but the value of the land is always affected.\n\nLandlocked properties suffer a loss in value.\n\nLandlocked Definition\n\nA landlocked piece of land is a parcel of property that has no legal access road. Landlocked properties are surrounded by land that is owned by others on all sides. Landlocked property usually results from a landowner subdividing his property into one or more parcels with no public roads in between.\n\nLand Appraisal\n\nAppraising the value of vacant land involves assessing the surrounding area and the land itself. The land parcel's size, shape, condition, slope, ease of building and zoning all affect its value. For example, a property may be zoned as residential and commercial, or just residential, or single-family home or a multi-unit property. Other characteristics affect the value of a piece of land, for example, if the property has an ocean view, the value would increase. Additionally, land value is influenced by the value of comparable properties in the area.\n\nLandlocked Value\n\nLandlocked parcels of land have a substantially reduced value because of the lack of access. Additionally, some cities will not allow building to take place on landlocked parcels which further reduces their value. Because so many factors are considered when appraising a piece of land, land owners must work with an experienced property appraiser to come up with a specific value for their piece of land.\n\nEasements\n\nEasements are used in real estate to create limited property rights for third parties. The third party gains the right to use someone else's property for a specifically defined purpose, even though the land does not belong to him. A property owner may choose to grant his neighbor an easement if his land blocks the neighbor's access to a road for property entry and exit.\n\nHistory of the Land\n\nOwners of landlocked parcels may find it worthwhile to learn about the land's history and find out if the property was correctly and legally subdivided. They may want to hire an attorney and check the property for possible existing easements that have been violated by owners of neighboring properties. For example, one owner of a landlocked piece of property found that a neighbor had constructed a lake over an ingress and egress, or entry and exit, easement. With the help of Courtney B. Harden, a civil litigation attorney, the land owner was able to get the neighbor to agree to an access road built on another portion of the neighbor's property."}
{"title": "Social Security Recipients and the Earned Income Tax Credit", "text": "The earned income credit is often confusing to many taxpayers. There are many qualification requirements, and the credit changes depending on the number of eligible children a taxpayer has. Recipients of social security benefits may be eligible to receive the earned income credit in certain circumstances. All taxpayers with lower incomes should calculate whether they are able to claim the credit.\n\nSocial security recipients can claim the earned income credit if they also have income from a job during the year.\n\nWho Can Claim\n\nThe first requirement for claiming the earned income credit is an income ceiling. If filing jointly, you can have a maximum income of $48,279 if you have three or more qualifying children, $45,295 if you have two, $40,463 if you have one, and $18,440 if you do not have any qualifying children. The credit disappears over these income limits. You can only claim the credit if you have earned income, which means income from employment or self-employment. You can also elect to include non-taxable combat pay in your calculations. Long-term disability benefits count as earned income if received before retirement. Another requirement is that investment income, such as from interest or dividends, must be lower than $3,100 in the year.\n\nSocial Security and Pension Benefits\n\nSocial security benefits do not count as earned income for the earned income credit on their own. If that is the only income you received during the year, you are not eligible for the credit. In the year that you begin to receive social security benefits, you may also have income from a job or from self-employment prior to receiving benefits. This income can be used for an earned income credit claim. Pension income from private or other government units is also not eligible for the earned income credit.\n\nSocial Security Disability\n\nThe Social Security Administration pays benefits to those under retirement age who are disabled and unable to do their former work or adjust to new work. This means that during the time that social security disability benefits are received, no employment or self-employment income will be received. This results in an ineligibility for the earned income credit. In the year that social security disability benefits are first received, or in the year they are no longer received, a taxpayer may also have employment income. This income is eligible for the earned income credit.\n\nHow to Claim\n\nThe earned income credit is usually claimed on the IRS form called Schedule EIC, and attached to the taxpayer's 1040 return. If you do not want to figure the credit out yourself, you can have the IRS do it for you. To have the IRS calculate your earned income credit, simply write \"EIC\" next to the box where the amount is calculated on the 1040. In certain circumstances, you may also be able to have advance earned income credit payments made to you during the year rather than waiting for the entire credit after filing your return."}
{"title": "What Happens After You File a Homestead Exemption in Texas?", "text": "Texas is one of several states offering property-tax deductions on the taxpayer's primary residence, known as the homestead exemption. After you file and qualify for a Texas homestead exemption with the local appraisal district office, you receive exemptions for the school tax, certain county or optional exemptions, depending on the place of residence, and exemptions based on age, military status or disability.Eligible taxpayers must reside in the homestead as of Jan. 1 of the tax year and it must be the principal residence. The dwelling must be owned by an individual or married couple, not a corporation or any type of business. Only homeowners qualify, not tenants. For those over 65 or disabled, the residency and ownership date of Jan. 1 is waived specifically for the over 65 or disabled portion of the homestead exemption.Determining the total tax on an individual property depends on three factors. The first is the property's appraised value as determined by the local appraisal district. The second is the number of exemptions for which the property owners qualify, and the third is the tax rate set by the local taxing jurisdiction. Once your property qualifies for the homestead exemption, the appraised value is likely lower than fair-market value due to the legal \u201chomestead cap.\u201d With the homestead cap, the property's value may only increase a maximum of 10 percent annually. Residential properties receive the homestead cap the year following the owner's homestead -exemption qualification.At the time of publication, all homestead owners receive a $15,000 exemption from the dwelling's value for school-tax purposes. Some counties collect special taxes for flood control or farm-to-market roads, and homestead owners in these counties receive a $3,000 exemption. Those age 65 or older or with disabilities receive an additional $10,000 school- tax exemption but cannot receive two exemptions for disability and age. Taxing units, including schools, counties, municipalities or special tax districts may offer exemptions of up to 20 percent of the homestead's value, with no optional exemption worth less than $5,000. Such taxing units may, at their discretion, offer additional exemption amounts of a minimum of $3,000 to those age 65 or older or who are disabled. The surviving spouses of 100- percent disabled military veterans continue to receive the spouse's exemption.Qualified Texas homesteads run the gamut of residential-dwelling units, from spreads of up to 20 acres to mobile homes and condominiums. Mobile homeowners must include the make and identification number of the unit on the application. It doesn't matter if the land is owned or leased by the taxpayer, as long as he owns the dwelling unit."}
{"title": "What Are Apprenticeship Programs?", "text": "An apprenticeship program combines on-the-job training with academic instruction for those entering the workforce. Also called dual-training programs because of the combined occupational and in-class components, apprenticeships help individuals put their academic skills to practical use in various careers.Whereas internships are often short-term, rarely lasting more than a year, apprenticeships can last as many as four or five years. Apprenticeships also differ from internships in that most apprentices are paid, with salary increasing as the apprentice completes parts of the program.Registered Apprenticeship ProgramsThe Office of Apprenticeship within the Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration provides a number of Registered Apprenticeship programs. These are apprenticeships approved by the government which often receive workforce development grants and tax benefits. Registered Apprenticeship programs offer career training in areas such as carpentry, home health care, electrical, law enforcement, and more.Find an Apprenticeship ProgramThe Department of Labor has a tool you can use to find apprenticeships near you. Glassdoor has a tool you can use to find apprenticeship/trainee programs. This tool includes both registered and non-registered trainee and apprenticeship opportunities.Apprenticeships vs. InternshipsWhat's the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship? Apprenticeships are formal paid long-term training programs that provide classroom and on-the-job training for skilled high paying jobs.Internships may be paid, but are of a shorter duration and don't provide formal certification or employment opportunities.Data and StatisticsDuring the US Government's fiscal year 2014, there were the following participants in registered apprentice programs:More than 170,500 individuals nationwide entered the apprenticeship systemThere are over 410,000 apprenticesOver 44,000 participants graduated from the apprenticeship system.Also Known As: dual-training program, training programExamples: George was in the electrical worker union's apprenticeship training program.

{"title": "Tie Series I-Bond Buying To Tax Refund?", "text": "investing\nTie your Series I-bond buying to tax refund?\nDear Dr. Don,\nWhat is the best time to buy Series I savings bonds in 2012 -- now or after the rate is reset later in the year? What is the maximum dollar amount you can purchase? Someone told me you can get around the maximum by purchasing them with an income tax refund.\n-- Mike Manipulate Dear Mike,\nIt's true that you can use your income tax refund to buy up to $5,000 in physical (paper) Series I bonds. Since you also have the ability to buy $10,000 in Series I bonds in electronic form through a TreasuryDirect account, using your tax refund to buy paper Series I savings bonds does allow you to increase the amount of bonds you can purchase in a year. I don't think there's a compelling reason to try to time either your tax refund or your electronic purchases of Series I savings bonds in 2012.\nIf you purchase these bonds with your tax refund, the amount you request must be evenly divisible by 50 because the minimum denomination of a paper Series I bond is $50. If you don't buy Series I savings bonds with 100 percent of your refund, you can elect to have the amount not used to purchase the bonds deposited into a bank account or mailed to you as a check. In filing your tax return, use Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Bond Purchases), to spell out the details. You can't really time the purchase of Series I savings bonds using your tax refund unless you file for a six-month extension on your tax return. The interest rate on the Series I bond changes on or about May 1 and Nov. 1 each year. A six-month extension on your income tax return only takes you to Oct. 15, 2012, so you only have two choices, not three, for these purchases. You can take today's rate, or wait for the May 1 announcement by filing for an extension. It's possible that the time it takes to process your refund will influence the date. The issue date will be the first day of the month in which the Internal Revenue Service submits payment for the bonds to the Treasury Retail Securities site in Minneapolis. For example, if the site in Minneapolis receives your order from the IRS on April 20, the issue date of your savings bonds will be April 1. Even though the Series I bonds currently pay no fixed rate of return, I still like them better than the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, in today's interest rate environment. For example, five-year TIPS are currently yielding inflation less 1.44 percent. That puts the Series I yield 1.44 percent higher than the five-year TIPS. I don't expect a change in the fixed-rate component when the Treasury announces its new savings bond rates in May. In trying to time the purchase, you're just dealing with the difference in the inflation component for the time period between a current purchase and the change in the inflation component in May, if any. Even if the fixed rate were to change, it would be a huge move if the fixed component went up to a tenth of a percentage point in yield. That increase on $5,000 is $5 per year. To me, it's not worth the angst in trying to time the purchase. File now. Buy now.\nGet more news, money-saving tips and expert advice by signing up for a free Bankrate newsletter."}
{"title": "Tips for Getting Out of High Risk Insurance Fast", "text": "Paying a higher rate on your insurance because of not carrying insurance for a period of time is frustrating for a lot of people. Car insurance is important to keep at all times because of the surcharge for a lapse. Once you get \u200bcar insurance again you will be paying high-risk rates for 6 continuous months.Tip: Once you obtain a policy, it is in your best interest to keep the same policy for six months. Switching before your six months is up, means you will have to start your six months over lengthening the time you pay the high-risk rate. It is possible you can use multiple declaration pages to prove six months of coverage, but the hassle usually isn't worth the savings.Three years is the usual time frame for minor violations to affect your insurance rates. If you are high risk due to multiple tickets or at fault accidents, you can get back into a preferred carrier once your oldest violation falls off. After a violation is 3 years old it typically comes off your record, however you have to wait for your renewal to see a difference in your rate if you are staying with the same carrier.Tip: Ask your insurance agent to give you the dates of all your violations. Switching to a preferred carrier the day after your violation falls off is a great way to save money fast.Tip: Not all insurance companies are the same. Some only count tickets received within the last 2 years. But, usually for multiple tickets the term is extended to 3 years.A major violation such as a DUI can affect your insurance rate up to 5 years for some insurance carriers. Lighter guidelines can be found with a few insurance carriers, but a preferred rate probably won't be available until 5 years have passed.A major violation usually comes with an extra requirement from the state. The state wants to be notified of your insurance coverage at all times. An SR 22 filing must be added onto your car insurance policy. The same is true if you were caught by police driving without car insurance.Tip: Start shopping around for an insurance carrier that does not surcharge for major violations after 3 years once your ticket is more than 3 years old. Start shopping again after 5 years to verify you are getting the cheapest car insurance possible.It is tough doing the time with the high rates of a high-risk driver status. Many high-risk drivers spend more than the allotted time high risk because they do not keep continuous insurance coverage. The length of time required to get out of high-risk insurance rates can easily be affected by your actions. More tickets and a lapse in coverage can extend your high rates infinitely. Keep your driving record in check and keep your insurance policy in effect at all times to escape high-risk rates.Let's Connect! Please Follow Me on Twitter @CarInsReview"}
{"title": "What is an SKU in Retail?", "text": "By definition, a Stock Keeping Unit (or SKU) is a number assigned to a product by a retail store to identify the price, product options and manufacturer of the merchandise. A SKU is used to track inventory in your retail store. They are very valuable in helping you maintain a profitable retail business. When accessed in your POS or accounting system, a SKU is a series of numbers that track unique information related to that product. Unlike UPCs, SKUs are not universal, meaning that each retailer has its own set of SKUs for its merchandise. Typically, SKUs are broken down into classifications and categories. Many retailers use the next series of numbers in the SKU to group products together for analysis.  For example, 25-10xxx are gas ovens and 25-20xxx are electric ovens. They next number might be a color indicator. So, 25-1001x are white ovens and 25-1002x are black ovens. And the list can go on from there.How Are SKUs Used? Did you ever wonder how Amazon.com was able to pick the perfect item to display as a \"suggestion\" for another idea when you are shopping? These SKUs are how they do that. Amazon.com has simply attached a unique SKU with all of its identifying traits to each product. So when you are looking at a blender, it can display other blenders you might like. But you won't see just any blender, you'll see ones that have the same features based on the SKU information. Most POS systems will allow you to create your SKU hierarchy or architecture. Before you create an elaborate system for your inventory, consider what you will truly track. If you are an independent retailer, the chances that you will track beyond classification is not that likely.For example, a shoe store might classify shoes based on customer type (men, women, children), then style (dress or casual), color, and perhaps material. Larger shoe stores may break down categories even further, into heel types or season. With an item's SKU, a retailer is able to track its inventory and sales through detailed reporting. And this reporting can be shared with our vendors to negotiate better terms and dating. Have you ever been in a retail store and seen the associate scan the SKU or UPC label to see if there were any more in the stockroom? Inventory management is the core function of an SKU, but it can also improve the customer shopping experience as in this example. Being able to identify electronically your stock levels reduces the time to care for the customer. Another great benefit of a SKU is in advertising. With the competitive landscape of retail today and everyone matching price, having a unique SKU can help protect your margins. For example, many retailers will put the SKU in the newspaper (ROP) versus the manufacturer's model number. Shoppers cannot determine if the washing machine they are looking at is the same one as the other store. And retailers don't have to match the price. It also helps reduce the practice of \"showrooming\" in your store as well.The Difference Between SKU and UPCSKU numbers are often confused with the terms barcode or UPC. While a barcode can be used like a SKU (meaning that all of the info discussed above can be tied to the barcode or UPC), they are not the same.For one, UPC stands for Universal Product Code. So unlike a SKU, this number and code is the same in every retailer. It also only tracks basic info. A retailer would have to add this UPC to its inventory database and assign it a SKU to make it work. However, many POS systems will allow you to use the UPC as the SKU in your store. You simply have to enter all of the classification details into your POS' inventory database to match. I preferred this method in my store."}

Should I get a fixed rate or adjustable rate mortgage?\nA: Well Sara, the optimal choice will depend on variables such as how long you plan to be in the home, and whether you expect steady or sharply higher income in the years to come.\nTo start, there is nothing wrong with opting for a fixed rate mortgage. With a fixed rate mortgage, what you get is permanent payment affordability. The fixed interest rate means the principal and interest components of your mortgage -- the largest part of your monthly household budget \u2013-- will never change. And that's a nice assurance to have, making it easier to plan around and enabling you to increase your standard of living as your income grows in future years while the mortgage payment holds steady.\nAn adjustable rate mortgage is more of a calculated risk, but one that can pay off nonetheless. If you expect to be in the home less than 10 years, for example, you can opt for a hybrid adjustable rate loan that offers a fixed rate for 10 years, before becoming adjustable annually thereafter. If your timetable pans out, then the loan functions as a fixed rate loan, but at a lower rate than a traditional fixed rate mortgage.\nIf you expect sharply higher income in future years, then the risk of a spike in the monthly payments on an adjustable rate loan is mitigated. But for the majority of homebuyers, you're better off avoiding any risk of future payment increases and just going with a fixed rate mortgage.\nI hope that helps and thanks for the question, Sara.\nIf you'd like me to answer your personal finance or money question, just upload your cell phone, camcorder, or webcam video to the link on the screen."}
{"title": "Do You Need a Needle Drop License for the Music Your Project Is Using?", "text": "A needle drop license is a somewhat outdated term in music, but the general principle still applies even in a non-vinyl medium. Essentially, a needle drop (also spelled needledrop) license allows the licensing party to use a part of a piece of music one time.Needle Drop Licenses in the Day of Vinyl RecordsThe term is associated with the days of vinyl, when as the record spun on a turntable the arm dropped the needle to the outer edge of record to play music.In the context of music licensing, the term needle drop poetically refers to when music is synchronized within another work such as a TV show, video or commercial. In essence, each time the \"needle drops\" on a record, a new license is needed. With a needle drop license, the user needs a new license each time the song or part of song is played, even if it is the same song or song snippet used within the same project.For instance, if you are making a commercial and want to use ten seconds of song X to start the commercial and the same ten seconds of the song to play out the commercial, that would require two needle drop licenses.Think of it as renting a piece of a piece of music to be played in a commercial or other production, rather than licensing the entire work. That would require a synchronization license.How Does a Needle Drop License Differ from a Synchronization License?A synchronization or \"sync\" license allows the license holder to sync music to a media output. Often sync licenses are used for TV shows and movies but any kind of visual paired with sound requires a sync license.When you hold a sync license, you are allowed to re-record that song for use in your project. If you want to use a specific version of the song by a specific artist, you also need to get a master recording license. Typically, a sync license is obtained from a music publisher while the master recording license is obtained from the record label or owner of the master.A sync license usually covers a specific period of time, and the license will stipulate in what manner the song can be used.What Does a Needle Drop License Cost?The cost of a needle drop license varies depending on the work being sampled, and the work in which it will be used.Needle drop segments are slightly different than sampling, which is the term for reusing part of a song, such as a chorus, in a different way within another song. This practice is fairly common within rap and hip-hop music."}
{"title": "Using A Roth IRA for your Childs College Tuition", "text": "taxes\nDear Tax Talk,\nMy wife has a Roth IRA, and we want to use it to help pay for our daughter's college tuition. I understand from reading the response to another question that the principal can be taken out without penalty. Is the principal amount also called the basis? Does using the money for a child's tuition meet the requirement of using it for education, or does it have to be for the education of the owner of the Roth? Lastly, if we take all the money out, principal and earnings, what are the consequences?\n-- Ray\nDear Ray,\nWhen taking a distribution, you have to determine what type of distribution you are receiving. Once you know that information, you can then figure out if it can be included in your income and if you are subject to the additional 10 percent tax on early distributions.\nSo, let's start with the different types of Roth IRA distributions. The first one is qualified distributions. These are not included in your gross income and additionally are not subject to the 10 percent additional tax on early distributions. According to the IRS, a qualified distribution must be made after the five-year period beginning with the first taxable year for which a contribution was made to a Roth IRA set up for your benefit. Other qualified distributions are those made on or after you reach the age of 59 1/2, distributions due to disability, payments made to a beneficiary or your estate after your death, or up to $10,000 of a distribution toward the purchase of a home if you meet the requirements for a first-time homebuyer.\nYou must pay the 10 percent additional tax on the taxable part of any distribution that is not a qualified distribution unless you meet one of the exceptions listed in IRS Publication 590 Individual Retirement Accounts. For nonqualified distributions, only the earnings are subject to tax. Your own contributions to a Roth IRA can be taken out anytime, tax-free.\nAn exception for education applies to payments made to qualified higher education expenses paid to eligible educational institutions for not only you and your spouse, but also your children and your grandchildren. So yes, that would apply to your daughter.\nYour wife's basis in her Roth IRA is the amount of after-tax dollars that has been contributed to the account -- in other words, her contribution.\nI hope this information is useful to you. On a final note, do not forget to take a look at IRS Publication 970 Tax Benefits for Education, as you may qualify for various credits or tax deductions if your daughter is your dependent."}
{"title": "Gone Fishing! Guidelines for Closing the Office for Vacation", "text": "Preparing your office for a temporary closure due to a vacation or other reason is as easy as following this checklist.  Done properly, your customers, vendors, and employees will be well aware of your scheduled business/office closure, and you can avoid angry customers and disgruntled employees upon your return. Additionally, you can also save some money. Customers will appreciate knowing the duration of the business being closed so that they're not frustrated by waiting for a response from your business while you're away.Office Vacation Closure: Notify Employees, Customers, and VendorsMake sure you notify key stakeholders in your company at least two to four weeks ahead of time. Employees can be notified/reminded using an insert in their paycheck. Customers can be notified on your website and via your automated attendant message on your phone system. Vendors (especially those with reoccurring delivery schedules) can be notified via email or regular postal mail.Notify Security Personnel/ServiceSend a memo to your security personal or security service notifying them of the closing dates. Make sure your emergency contact list is up to date with key employee phone numbers.Change Automated Attendant GreetingSchedule your automated attendant greeting on your phone system to reflect that the office closed. Make sure you also state when the office will reopen. If you provide emergency services (i.e. heating and cooling, plumbing, etc.) be sure to tell your callers how to reach your answering service or your cell phone during the shutdown.Notify Answering ServiceIf you use an answering service make sure to notify them of the dates that the office will be shut down and make sure your contact list is up to date with employee phone numbers that will be on call.Change Voicemail Greetings and Create Auto Reply EmailsIf your phone system allows external calls to ring directly to your employees' desks, then you need to make sure that they use a temporary or \"Out of Office\" voicemail greeting that lets the caller know that they are not in the office. Your employees should also let the call know when they will return and what to do if they need immediate assistance while the office is closed for the holiday. Additionally, be sure to create an Out of Office email autoreply.Reduce ThermostatSave some energy and some money by setting back (or reprogramming) your office thermostat during the shutdown.Servers BackupIf you have critical computers and servers, make sure the backup cycle runs properly before and after the shutdown. Reduce your exposure to a disaster by scheduling your offsite backup for an early pickup rather than waiting for after the holiday shutdown to be over.Turn Off Office EquipmentDesk lightsCopiersCalculatorsOverhead lightsShreddersTurn Off Computers & PeripheralsComputerMonitorScannerPrinterDo NOT Turn OffFax machinesPhone SystemServer ComputersHeaters/Lights for Tropical Fish Tanks"}
{"title": "Exposing A Phantom Debt Collection Scam", "text": "I received a call saying I owed money to the IRS and if I didn't pay it right that minute, I'd have to appear in court in the next hour.\nEven though I knew the person on the other end was a fraudster, I felt intimidated and a little frightened. Once I had a chance to think through what was going on, I played along and asked for his phone number so I could get \"right back to him.\" Instead, I reported the number to the IRS.\nThe \"phantom debt\" scam takes a variety of forms, but as a general swindle, it ranked in the Better Business Bureau's top 10 reported crimes in 2014 and 2015.\nVery old debt or debt you don't owe\nThe phantom debt scam is used to describe a very old debt or a debt you don't really owe for which someone is trying to collect. \"It 'haunts' you, hence the name,\" says Katherine Hutt, spokeswoman for the Council for Better Business Bureaus.\nThis method of tricking people out of their money has plagued us for a long time, she says. But it has become a bigger issue in the past 20 years. We are a more debt-driven society now with mortgages, car loans, student loans, personal loans, credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt.\nThe more types of debt you acquire during your lifetime, the easier it is to become a victim of the phantom debt scam. Fraudsters know this and fabricate debts to collect, Hutt says.\nRobo-threats\nThese calls can come from anywhere and the perpetrator can even spoof caller ID so it looks like the call is coming from a legitimate organization. Perpetrators may use recorded messages to try to intimidate you.\nRobo-calls sound urgent so you'll call back, Hutt says. Often, the caller speaks in a gruff voice and says you must call back immediately. If you call, someone attempts to convince you that you owe the debt with aggressive and intimidating language, and threats of legal action, arrest and a negative credit report.\nSometimes, they bully you by saying they'll notify your family or your employer. Legitimate debt collection agencies usually follow the law, but scammers feel no such compunction. These criminals may threaten to talk with your neighbors, says Coleen Pantalone, a professor of finance at D'Amore-McKim School of Business, Northeastern University in Boston.\n\"They want you to make a payment over the phone so they talk fast,\" she says.\nLegit debt collectors vs. fraudsters\nThe debt that fraudsters try to collect might not be yours. It could be that of a deceased family member, which makes it harder to know if it's genuine or not. Pantalone says the debt might even belong to someone unrelated to you, but with your name.\nUnder the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, legitimate callers can call only between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. -- no middle-of-the-night calls. This act also prevents continuous calls to the same number and the use of profane or abusive language, says Pantalone.\nAnother red flag that you're talking with a fraudster is when the caller asks for your credit card and Social Security numbers. That's when you should hang up.\n\"Scammers may send you a form letter if their phone calls don't net a response,\" says Jonathan Stein, a consumer law attorney in Elk Grove, California. \"It may have typos and/or an address in New York.\"\nOnce you pay one of them, you're considered a mark, and they gladly pass your name on to heir fellow fraudsters so they can continue draining your bank account, Stein says.\nHow to respond\nThese swindles even snare sophisticated people, Stein says. To avoid losing your money, don't speak to anyone on the phone whom you don't know.\nHutt says to never return robo-calls. If you do owe money, legitimate government agencies and debt collectors will almost always communicate by mail first.\nIf you think the debt may be genuine, ask the caller for his or her contact information and say you'll call them back. Instead, call the company you owe directly, using a phone number you've gotten from a legitimate source like the back of your credit card, your bank or the lender's website.\nPantalone suggests requesting your credit report from the 3 credit reporting agencies to see if any debt problems show up. You can request a report from each once a year for free.\n\"When you get your reports, look them over carefully to make sure they're accurate,\" Pantalone says. \"If anything looks wrong, file a report with that particular credit bureau, contesting the item.\"\nFREE TOOL: Get your credit report today, free and with no obligation, at myBankrate.\nDon't give out personal information\nHutt says to never give out personal or financial information. Fraudsters use your name, address, date of birth, bank account information and credit card numbers to steal your identity.\nDon't act impulsively, Hutt says. If the debt is legitimate, request documentation to support the claim.\n\"If you feel frightened or intimidated, report the call to your local police department. Tell the caller that you intend to do so,\" Hutt says. \"If they hang up, then they are scammers.\""}

{"title": "How Landlords Use Blockbusting to Get Homes Ilegally", "text": "Definition:Blockbusting is a method of manipulating homeowners to sell or rent their homes at a lower price by falsely convincing them that racial, religious or other minorities are moving into their once segregated neighborhood. It is illegal to engage in blockbusting.Example: A real estate agent hires a black woman to walk her dog in an all white neighborhood. He then places his real estate card in all the mailboxes on the block, offering to buy their houses right away at a discounted price. The goal is to convince the property owners that he is \"helping them out,\" because their home values will decline due to the influx of minorities in the area.Fair Housing:Treating an individual differently because they belong to a certain class of people is illegal. When it comes to any activity that relates to housing, all classes of people must be treated equally. The Federal Fair Housing Act was a law enacted in 1968  to address this issue. It specifically protects seven classes of people from discrimination. These classes are:ColorDisabilityFamilial StatusNational OriginRaceReligionSexThe goal of this act is to end discrimination in renting and selling and in mortgage lending. Using race to attempt to get homeowners to sell their homes, otherwise known as blockbusting, would be illegal under the Federal Fair Housing Act. If an individual believes they have been a victim of housing discrimination, they can file a claim with HUD.You should also check your local state's laws. Many states actually have their own Fair Housing laws which protect classes in addition to the seven original that are protected by Federal Fair Housing.Factors That Decrease Property Value:That are certain factors that are in your control that can cause the value of your property to decrease. These factors include not keeping up with property maintenance. If you have an overgrown yard, it will negatively affect the price you will be able to list your house at. By simply cutting the grass, your property will have better curb appeal and you may be able to charge slightly more because the home looks cared for.The are other factors that are beyond your control that can cause the value of your property to decrease. These factors include: Mortgage Rates: When mortgage rates increase, people are not able to get as much for their money. The same house that they would have been able to afford before rates were increased, may now become unaffordable because their monthly payments will be higher. Therefore, to appeal to the same buyer, you may have to lower your homes price to get it to sell. Weather: If a natural disaster occurs in the area where your home is located, it can cause the value of your property to significantly decrease. For example, a hurricane may cause significant flooding in an area that never had issues with flooding. Your property may now be classified in a flood zone, which will make people more apprehensive about buying. It will be more difficult to sell your  property for top dollar. Short Sales/Foreclosures: Another factor that can cause your property value to decrease are short sales or foreclosures in the neighborhood. When trying to determine the value of your home, an appraiser will use comparables in your neighborhood.Even if the similar properties are short sales, the appraiser will still use them to price your home, decreasing the value of your property.              Potential buyers may also be hesitant to buy in your neighborhood if there are a large number of               shorts sales or foreclosures. They could be concerned that the neighborhood is on the decline."}

{"title": "How to Calculate Real Disposable Income", "text": "The government maintains a set of national accounts that reveal the current state of the economy. One of these accounts is real disposable income, or RDI, which is the amount of money Americans have to spend and save after accounting for income taxes and inflation. You can calculate your personal RDI to gauge how well your income is keeping up with inflation. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis uses 2009 as the starting point for measuring RDI inflation, but you can use any year that makes sense to you.\n\nReal disposable income reveals your spending power after inflation.\n\ncredit: vovan13/iStock/Getty Images\n\nStep\n\nDetermine your gross income for the last full tax year. Your gross income is the pre-tax amount you receive in salary, wages, investment income, alimony and any other forms of income. For example, you might have a gross income of $64,600.\n\nStep\n\nSubtract your income taxes for the latest full tax year. This includes federal, state and local income taxes. The result is your disposable income for the year, the amount you can use to invest, save and pay your bills. If you paid $11,000 in income tax for the year, your disposable income is $64,600 minus $11,000, or $53,600.\n\nStep\n\nLook up the Consumer Price Index for the last full tax year and for an earlier year of your choosing. For example, if you want to measure the effect of inflation from 2009 through 2013, look up the CPIs for those years, which were 214.537 and 232.957, respectively. This information is available from several websites and is published by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nStep\n\nCalculate the ratio of the CPIs for the two years. In this example, divide 214.537 into 232.957, giving 1.0859.\n\nStep\n\nApply the change ratio to find your real disposable income. In this example, divide 1.0859 into your disposable income for the latest full tax year: $53,600 / 1.0859 equals $49,361.83. This amount represents the buying power of your disposable income in 2009 dollars."}

Throughout the year you can use these funds to pay for approved medical costs and to help cover the cost of daycare. Your employer may reimburse you or provide you with a special debit card to access the money. It is important to follow the guidelines when accessing the money.\n\nA flexible spending account can be used to pay hospital bills.\n\nDoctors and Hospital Costs\n\nYou can use the money in your flexible spending account to pay for co-payments and co-insurance costs as well as your annual health insurance deductible. You can also use the money to pay for dental work, to visit the eye doctor and to pay for physical therapy. Some forms of counseling can be covered with your flexible spending account, but double check with your human resources department before you assume that it is covered.\n\nChildcare\n\nMost employers require you to have a different flexible spending account to cover childcare costs, and not all employers will offer a childcare account. This FSA allows you to contribute a set amount each month before taxes are withdrawn. You may be reimbursed the costs or your employer may pay the daycare center directly. Your daycare provider will need to provide the business's tax identification number to receive payments from the flexible spending account.\n\nMedical Supplies\n\nSome medical supplies can be covered by a flexible spending account. You can use it to purchase prescription medication and supplies such as crutches. You may be able to use it purchase medically necessary items such as wheelchairs, walkers and other major medical supplies. To qualify, these expenses may need a prescription from a doctor. Talk to your plan's administrator to be sure the cost is covered before purchasing an item.\n\nProhibited Uses\n\nThere are restrictions on what a flexible spending account can be used for. Starting in 2011 flexible spending accounts cannot be used for over-the-counter medication such as pain relievers, allergy medicine or cold medicine. This also limits the purchase of things like bandages and other medical supplies that used to be covered.

{"title": "Installation Overview Naval Weapons Station Earle NJ", "text": "Naval Weapons Station Earle is a United States Navy base located in Colts Neck, New Jersey. NWS Earle is one of the most serene and beautiful Navy installations in the country.Naval Weapons Station Earle's history began in 1943, with the great need for an Ammunition Depot in the New York area to support the war effort. The location provided ships with a safe and operationally advantageous port to take on ammunition, and it also had access to commercial rail facilities with lines coming from the west, where the majority of ammunition shipments originated. The rural location of the site also allowed for minimal dislocation of the local population.On Aug. 2, 1943, construction began on what was to be Naval Ammunition Depot Earle, named after Rear Admiral Ralph Earle, the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance during World War One. Construction included building the military road and railway connecting main-side complex, the waterfront complex and the pier.The pier stretches 2.2 miles into the Sandy Hook bay and comprises 2.9 miles of pier/trestle surface area. Earle continued to develop after World War II, keeping pace with the changing needs of the Navy. In 1974, Earle's name was officially changed to Naval Weapons Station Earle. The Station is divided into two sections: Main-side, located in Colts Neck, and the Waterfront Area, on Sandy Hook Bay, located in the Leonardo section of Middletown.

Power's annual Credit Card Satisfaction Survey.\nAmerican Express, which tied Discover for the top spot last year and topped the rankings the other 7 years J.D. Power has conducted its survey, came in 2nd. JPMorgan Chase came in third.\nWhy should you care?\nUltimately, the right credit card for you comes down to what you intend to use it for. But the rankings are helpful in determining how each of the major issuers rate when stacked against each other. Take a look:\nThe rest of the story\nJ.D. Power rates major credit card issuers by 6 factors (listed here in order of importance): interaction, credit card terms, billing and payment, rewards, benefits and services and problem resolution.\nDiscover scored 828 points on a 1,000-point scale, netting high marks across all 6 categories. Its performance shouldn't really come as a surprise, given the issuer made several consumer-friendly changes over the last year.\nIn November, Discover eliminated rewards expiration dates. In June, it debuted a double rewards bonus offer geared toward new cardholders, and it also launched Freeze It, a security feature that enables cardholders to turn a card \"on\" and \"off\" if they misplace it.\nGetting the best cards\nOverall satisfaction with issuers is at a record high of 790, surpassing the previous high of 778 in the 2014 study.\nJ.D. Power found rewards and benefits are the 2 main reasons customers choose a credit card. They're also key drivers of satisfaction and spending on a primary card, though past Bankrate research suggests these points aren't as sticky as one may think.\nIn any event, premium credit cards, which feature the best benefits, are reserved for consumers with stellar credit, so if J.D.

{"title": "How Can a Student Get a Low-Income Apartment?", "text": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides housing assistance to qualified low-income households. The public housing and project-based rental subsidy programs allow low-income families to pay 30 percent of their income toward rent. HUD pays for the remaining portion of the rent. Students may be eligible for HUD's housing assistance programs if they meet income and independent household eligibility requirements. You can obtain an application for a low-income apartment at the local housing authority.\n\nStudents can apply for HUD's low-income apartment housing programs.\n\nIncome Limits\n\nStudents must meet the income limit requirements to be eligible for a low-income apartment. HUD Public Housing facilities require that applicants have income at or below the low-income limit level or 80 percent of the area median income. Some areas have more restrictive limits and may require applicants to have incomes that do not exceed 50 percent of the area's median income or the very-low income limit level. The income limit will also be based on the size of the family. Families with more than one household member can have a higher income than a household of one. Income limits have been established for every family size.\n\nEligibility\n\nFor a student to be determined eligible for low-income housing, she must demonstrate her independence from parents. The student is required to be of legal contract age under state law and have established a separate household from her parents for at least one year prior to submitting a housing application. The student also cannot be claimed as a dependent on IRS income tax returns and she must obtain a certification of how much financial assistance is provided by a parent, even if there is none provided. Any financial aid provided from the institution of higher education or private sources will be used to calculate income unless the student is over the age of 23 and has a dependent child.\n\nApplication Process\n\nTo apply for a low-income apartment the student must obtain an application for assistance and provide documentation of income and student eligibility requirements. In addition, the student will have to provide a Social Security number, a copy of his identification card and evidence of citizenship. Noncitizen applicants with a student visa are ineligible for assistance. If the applicant has a spouse or dependents who are U.S. citizens, the family will receive prorated assistance to include only the family members who are citizens. The household will also be screened for drug-related criminal history and sex-offender registration. If any household member is found to have one of these in their background, the family will not be admitted into the low-income apartment.\n\nLeasing Requirements\n\nEvery household member over the age of 18 is required to sign a HUD Model Lease. The lease outlines the responsibilities of the student and HUD to pay for the rent. The low-income apartment owner is allowed to collect a refundable security deposit at the time of move-in. The owner must conduct a move-in inspection with the student prior to occupancy to confirm any existing damages. Once the student vacates the apartment, she must provide a 30-day notice of intent to move and a forwarding address to get a refund of the security deposit. The owner will deduct any repair expenses from the deposit and must provide a itemized list of expenses that were deducted to the student."}
{"title": "Checklist for Property Inspection Walkthrough", "text": "Whether you're buying a new home or moving into a rental, conduct a property inspection walkthrough. The purpose of this pre move-in inspection is to make sure the property is safe, the appliances and other systems are in working order, and that the home meets the criteria of your purchase contract or lease. You'll need a checklist, notes and possibly photos or video to keep track of what you see. A walkthrough is a must, but it should not take the place of a professional home inspection when buying a home.\n\nMan checking the smoothness of a wall\n\ncredit: Design Pics/Design Pics/Getty Images\n\nWhere to Find A Checklist\n\nDownload a walk-through checklist or create your own. Your real estate agent or landlord may also provide one. However, it's still a good idea to have your own list to supplement items not listed on theirs. If you're buying the property, the inspection is that much more critical, as any problems that arise will be yours. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has a free comprehensive walkthrough checklist for buyers or renters. Renters can also find a list at Checklist.com.\n\nFeatures of A Thorough List\n\nA checklist should divide the property by rooms, along with key components you need to check in each room. There should be a section for the living room, kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, areas like patios and garages, and any exterior or additional structures. There should be space allotted on the list to note the general condition of the room, hazards, working order and security of features such as windows and gates.\n\nMajor Systems\n\nA walkthrough includes checking all major systems in the property, including heating, ventilation and air conditioning units, plumbing, electrical systems, sewage or septic systems and overall structural soundness. Renters of newer properties should also check features such as Wi-Fi capability or Internet connectivity speeds if such features are offered in the lease. Homes may also have water softening systems and solar paneling, which require final inspection, as well.\n\nA Buyer\u2019s Perspective\n\nA homebuyer's final walk-through inspection may be more involved than a renter's move-in inspection. A final walkthrough requires you to confirm the home's cleanliness and that any repairs that were originally agreed upon, have been made. You should also confirm that the home has all features, such as appliances, fixtures and any furnishings that were stipulated in the purchase contract. It is the buyer's opportunity to make sure the home is in acceptable condition before closing."}

{"title": "4 Big Reasons Your Budget Keeps Failing", "text": "Some people just aren\u2019t able to stick to a budget. It\u2019s not their fault; they must have something in their DNA that makes them awful at it. Or maybe they\u2019re just horrible people.If you\u2019ve ever felt this way about yourself, it\u2019s time to stop being so hard on yourself and get to the bottom of why you\u2019re really having trouble making your budget work. It\u2019s quite possible the odds are stacked against you by one (or more) of the following things that make it nearly impossible to budget successfully.Identify the traps you\u2019re falling into, and you may find it surprisingly easy to start sticking to that budget after all.1. It\u2019s Not RealisticYour budget isn\u2019t supposed to be a wish list of how you wish you could spend your money if everything was perfect. It\u2019s supposed to be a tool that helps you spend the money you have in a way that covers the expenses you need to cover. In order to do this, you need to be real about your situation.If you\u2019re trying to feed a family of 5 on a $20-a-month grocery budget, you\u2019re probably not going to succeed. If you\u2019re trying to put aside $500 a month in savings when you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck, you may need to dial your aim down a notch. You want to challenge yourself, yes, but not set yourself up for a goal that\u2019s impossible.2. It Doesn\u2019t Let You Have Any FunIt\u2019s hard to stick to your budget day in and day out when you feel like all it\u2019s doing is telling you things you can\u2019t have or can\u2019t do. It\u2019s like trying to lose weight by eating nothing but crackers and water; eventually you\u2019ll get so fed up with your barebones diet you\u2019ll splurge and eat an entire ice cream sundae out of frustration. You need to budget in a little \u201cfun,\u201d even if it\u2019s only a few bucks a week to buy a magazine or a latte.3. You Haven\u2019t Planned for the UnexpectedYou absolutely must have an emergency savings fund if you want to be able to stick to your budget. Emergency savings covers all those unexpected, pricey things that crop up and threaten to ruin your budget: car repairs, medical bills, etc. Start saving now so you can handle these things in the future.4. You\u2019re Not Following ItThis is where we say that, while you should stop beating yourself up, you do need to be honest with yourself. Do you have any bad habits that are keeping your otherwise-useful budget from really doing its job? Do you tend to give in to impulse purchases? Is shopping a hobby for you? Do you make a lot of \u201cjust this one time\u201d exceptions when you\u2019re faced with an out-of-budget purchase? Even if your budget is airtight, it will never truly work unless you\u2019re willing to put in the work yourself and follow its guidelines."}
{"title": "7 Marketing Ideas That You May Not Have Thought Of", "text": "Marketing is a field that as we know is ever-changing. As a result, finding a truly unique idea is often difficult. However, that doesn't mean you've exhausted all of your marketing efforts; you still have room to grow and to speak to new audience members, sometimes is just takes a little creativity.  My hope is that even if you don't use one of the ideas listed below it will help you in generating a new idea that works for you. Sell Snacks and Gear at Wineries If you live in area with wineries, breweries or distilleries around, you may have a new market for your products. People love to eat when they're tasting different drinks, so you could offer food samples with the tasting and sell food for purchase after. You may also provide graphic design services for t-shirts, postcards or other items. You're marketing through products and making money in the process.  Facebook Advertisements For those of you who are Facebook users, maybe you never paid too much attention to the advertisements on the side of the page. However, by giving them a second glance, you'll realize that they are targeted toward you and the things that you have recently searched online. By using Facebook advertisements, you're directly reaching out to people who have recently searched for your products.  Awnings as Signs If you have a shop where people can sit or shop outside, you probably notice that the numbers decrease when the weather is bad. By putting up an awning, you are combating at least some of those issues. Furthermore, this awning can act as a sign. The sign will call out to people who are walking around in the community and encourage them to come to your shop.   Sidewalk Chalk Help people who are in a bid to return to a simpler time by letting sidewalk chalk do the speaking for you. Of course, you need to obtain permission from the city or town, but as long as you have the go, you can really grab the interest of people walking by. Use bright colors to announce your business, and you can even draw footsteps to show them how to walk to the shop.  Local Plays  When the community has a local playhouse, you have the opportunity to bring products to the stage. Big companies love to see their products appear in movies and television shows, so you can do so on a smaller scale. Find out if the directors are willing to incorporate any of your products into some of the show's scenes. Also, many people will pick up a playbill on their way into the play, and you can find out if advertising space is available there.   Contests for Marketing People love to enter contests because they all eagerly hope that they have a decent chance of winning. No matter what type of social media page you have, you can set up a contest on it. The prize can include a gift certificate to your shop or a box filled with assorted goodies from your store. This content will help to drive traffic to the site and show prospective customers what you have to offer.   Fresh Content You love all of the content that you currently have your on your website, and you feel as though it really speaks to the goals of your business. However, people are going to stop visiting the pages if all they see is the same material again and again. Don't under-appreciate the value of fresh content. You can even ask some local writers to produce material for the pages, and they can bring their following along with them.  Marketing is a field that is only likely to grow in the future, and these ideas can help you to stay ahead of the other companies."}
{"title": "Redeemable vs. Retractable Preferred Shares", "text": "With redeemable preferred shares, the issuer has the right to redeem the outstanding stock from the buyers at a specific price. Redeemable preferred shares are also referred to as callable preferred shares. Retractable preferred shares give the buyer the right to sell the stock back to the issuer at a specific fixed price.Preferred stock is an equity security, although it operates more like a debt security. Investors often refer to preferred stock as a hybrid security because it has both debt and equity features. By selling preferred stocks, companies receive equity. Companies use this equity for special projects, expansion or to improve their debt-to-equity ratio. Preferred stocks pay out dividends to its shareholders, much like debt securities. However, unlike debt securities such as bonds, dividends do not accumulate between payment dates.When you buy preferred shares, the company from which you buy the shares can buy them back on or after a specific date, and at the specific price listed on your preferred stock agreement. Preferred shares are also referred to as callable preferred shares because after the date on the agreement passes, the company can call the stock at any time and retire the shares. When a company retires preferred shares, it buys the outstanding shares at the call price plus any dividend arrearage so it can discontinue paying dividends.Retractable preferred shares have a maturity date and a price noted on the stock agreement. When retractable preferred shares reach maturity, you have the right to sell them back to the stock issuer at the price stated on the agreement. If you do not want to sell your shares at maturity, the issuer can force you to do so. The issuer also has the option of exchanging retractable preferred shares for common shares instead of cash. This is referred to as soft-retractable preferred shares.In return for your preferred stock investment, companies pay you a dividend but unlike common shareholders, you don\u2019t get to own a piece of the company. If a company offers dividends on both preferred and common stock, the preferred stock dividends are higher. If the company files for bankruptcy, it has to pay off its debts first. Then, it pays its bondholders. and after that, it pays its preferred shareholders. If there is anything left, it will pay its common shareholders."}

{"title": "Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) vs. Combo Loans", "text": "Up until President Bush signed into law the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, mortgage insurance premiums were not tax deductible. As of January 1, 2007, borrowers can now deduct those payments. On the surface, this sounds like good news for first-time home buyers. But is it?One of the driving forces behind taking out piggyback loans, also called combo loans, was the tax deduction available for paying all that interest versus paying a mortgage insurance premium that was not tax deductible on a single loan. The second benefit is that the total payments on a combo loan are often much lower than a payment with PMI.How Combo Loans WorkCombo or piggyback loans are financing that combines a first mortgage with a second mortgage (with or without a down payment). The reasons these types of loans are appealing are because many home buyers do not have 20% of the purchase price in cash or do not want to put down 20% to buy a home -- and combo loans sidestep the requirement to pay PMI. Common types of combo loans are: 5/15/80. This scenario involves putting down 5%, and financing a first mortgage of 80% of the purchase price, coupled with a second mortgage comprising 15% of the purchase price.  10/10/80. This scenario involves putting down 10%, and financing a first mortgage of 80% of the purchase price, coupled with a second mortgage comprising 10% of the purchase price.  80/20. This scenario involves putting down zero, and financing a first mortgage of 80% of the purchase price, coupled with a second mortgage comprising 20% of the purchase price.The interest rates on a second mortgage are higher than those on a first mortgage, but sometimes the total payments are less than those financed on a first mortgage with private mortgage insurance. Moreover, since combo loans reached a peak in 2005, many borrowers are considering other options because of short-term interest rate fluctuations.Comparing PMI and Combo LoansLet's compare two borrowers with identical FICO scores of 680. Here is how the numbers work:80/20 FinancingSay the Klingon family buys a $500,000 home using 80/20 financing. The first mortgage would be at 6.25% and payable at $2,462.87 per month for principal and interest. The second mortgage would be at 8.5% and payable at $768.91 per month, principal and interest.Total payments for a combo loan: $3,232100% with PMIBut the Romulan family buys a $500,000 home using 100% financing with PMI insurance. The first mortgage would be also at 6.25% but payable at $3,079, and PMI insurance adds another $400 to that payment.Total payments for a first mortgage with PMI: $3,479.The Romulan family needs to wait two years, and obtain an appraisal to show 20% equity, to get rid of the insurance. But say the Romulans do, and the payment drops to $3,079 without PMI. The Romulans would not pay less than the Klingons until month 63 of the loan.Features of Income Tax Provision for MMI / PMIMortgage Insurance premiums (MMI) are paid on FHA, Rural Housing Loans, and some conventional loans require private mortgage insurance (PMI), both of which are deductible subject to certain provisions:The Tax Relief and Health Care Act provision for PMI tax deductions applies to funding after Dec. 31, 2006. This means home owners can deduct mortgage insurance on loans taken out in 2007. Even better news is the fact that under the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, the PMI tax deduction has been extended through 2010. Available to persons filing joint or single returns with less than $100,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI), or $50,000 AGI for married persons filing separately. Most people need to earn at least $50,000 to make itemizing a better break than taking the standard deduction, so this pretty much narrows the qualifications to those earning over $50,000 yet less than $100,000. Families earning above $110,000 AGI cannot take a deduction. But for those who earn between $100,000 and $110,000 AGI, the deduction phases out by 10% per $1,000. The deduction is available on refinances if the original loan amount does not increase. Bump your loan fees into the loan, and you will probably exceed the original balance and not qualify.Experts are predicting another renewal of the provision based on the following:The mortgage insurance tax deduction ends up benefiting taxpayers.The provision is well received by home buyers.The ability to deduct mortgage insurance helps more first-time home buyers purchase homes.At the time of writing, Elizabeth Weintraub, DRE # 00697006, is a Broker-Associate at Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, California."}

{"title": "Bank of Mom not kids' financial crutch", "text": "Dear Debt Adviser,\nI am the parent of a 21-year-old and 19-year-old. They both have been out of work, one for six months and the other for one year. I am paying all their bills as well as mine, including my son's car loan, my daughter's college townhome rent, both of their gas and phone bills, and insurance. This is what is sending me into debt.\nMy daughter is trying to finish college. If I give up, she will have to pull out of school, pack her bags and come home. My son is living at home, but cannot find work in our rural area. I'm draining my home equity line of credit, or HELOC,\u00a0in paying their bills, and my credit card bills are getting high! I'm sure a lot of people are in this spot now. Any ideas?\n-- Kelly\nDear Kelly,\nI remember when I told my son that he would have to take out some student loans to cover a portion of his college tuition. Now mind you, he was and is a great kid. His response was, \"Can't you work harder or something?\" Now he wasn't being mean. He just didn't understand how finances worked on a personal level. He does now! My take is that your kids don't know either. So it's up to you to have a serious conversation with them.\nYou and your children are up against some tough decisions. I don't recommend jeopardizing your own financial well-being for your children's debts. It would be different if you could afford to help them financially, but you are going into significant debt to do so -- debt that will likely take you many years to repay. This may put you in a weakened position, and it could possibly preclude you from being the financially strong parent they may need in the future when a really serious problem comes along and they need your support.\nHere's my take on your situation. I believe it is time for your children to begin handling more of their own debt. I completely understand that you want your daughter to finish college. I want that, too. However, the Bank of Mom is running short of funds, so your daughter needs to apply for school loans to finish her education. I recommend she schedule a visit with the financial aid office at her school as soon as possible. It may not be too late to get some funding for the spring semester. She can apply for loans that will cover her school expenses as well as reasonable living expenses. In addition, she may find some work/study programs with the school that would help her to pay her bills. If that doesn't work out, then she might consider a less expensive community college for a year or two.\nNow for your son. The current job market is dismal in most places, so it is not likely your son will be hired for the position he would prefer, at least not now. However, it is likely he could be hired for a less desirable position. It is unlikely that any job he gets now will end up being in his final career field. That's OK. He can obtain valuable work lessons in any job. After all, the key to most any entry-level job is showing up on time and getting along with others. Bottom line, he needs to find employment, doing whatever and wherever it may be, and to start paying most of his own debts.\nOnce you get your children off the payroll, I recommend you develop a household spending plan that includes agreed-upon expenses, contributions from the kids and an amount to pay down your credit card balances and home equity line of credit. I would tackle the credit card debt first and then the HELOC. Paying down the card balances first is important because most cardholder agreements can be changed by the issuer. With high balances, any change to the agreement would likely mean a higher payment for you.\nGood luck!\nTo ask a question of the Debt Adviser go to the \"Ask the Experts\" page and select \"Debt\" as the topic.

{"title": "United States Air Force &amp;ndash; Aerial Demonstration Teams", "text": "When one thinks of a United States Air Force (USAF) demonstration team, the first that pops to mind is likely the Thunderbirds - which has been an air demonstration squadron since 1953, making them the third-oldest formal flying acrobatic team under the same name in the world and second oldest in the United States. In addition to the Thunderbirds, the USAF Air Combat Command also fields Single-Ship Demonstration Teams that perform precision aerial maneuvers in order to demonstrate to the public the unique capabilities of Air Force's high-performance aircraft.   There are six single-ship demonstration teams within ACC, consisting of two A-10 Thunderbolt teams, two F-15 Eagle teams, and two F-16 Fighting Falcon teams.And then there is the USAF Heritage Flight program. Established in 1997 in support of the Air Force's 50th anniversary, it involves today's state-of-the-art fighters flying in close formation with World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War vintage fighters - such as the P-51 Mustang and the F-86 Sabre. The mission of Heritage Flight is to safely and proudly display the evolution of United States Air Force Airpower.And speaking of vintage fighter craft\u2026 since the USAF was formed in 1947, there have been several aerial demonstration teams. A short-lived team formed in 1949 was the USAF \u201cRed Devils\u201d, flying four P-51 Mustangs.The first official USAF jet-powered aerobatic demo team was the \"Acrojets\", formed in 1948 and performing early in 1949 with F-80A Shooting Stars, later transitioning to the F-80C, and ending with the T-33 Shooting Star.  The Acrojets were inactivated in 1950, when the US became involved in the Korean War.In 1949, the \"Skyblazers\" were formed, representing the United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE), flying F-80B Shooting Stars.  This squadron was active until it was disbanded in 1962, seldom appearing outside of the jurisdiction of USAFE operations in Europe, and transitioned from the F-80 to the F-84E Thunderjet in 1950, the F-86F Sabre in 1955, and the F-100C Super Sabre in 1956.  The team disbanded becase their home squadron (22nd Fighter Squadron from the 36th Fighter Wing) was rotated back to the United States and their assigned aircraft transitioned to the F-105 Thunderchief.In 1950, the \"Sabre Dancers\" aerobatic demonstration team was formed.  This team of 4 flew the F-86A Sabre, and was disbanded in 1953 when the Thunderbirds team was established so the official aerial demonstration team of the USAF.In 1954, several aerial demonstration teams were formed:The \u201cBlack Knights\u201d - an aerial demonstration team organized formed with pilots of the 38th Tactical Bombardment Wing in France.  This team was unique for its use of the B-57 Canberra and was disbanded in 1958.The \"Sabre Knights\" \u2013 an aerobatic display team organized by pilots of the United States Air Defense Command's 325th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (325 FIS), starting with the F-86F Sabres and shortly thereafter using the F-86D Saber.  This team was never officially recognized as a demonstration team, and the Sabre Knights came to an end when the 325 FIS was deactivated.The USAF \u201cComet\u201d \u2013 an aerobatic display team organized by pilots of the USAF's 5th Air Force no Osan Air Base, Korea and flew four T-33 Shooting Star trainers.  The team was discontinued in 1955.The \"Arctic Gladiators\" - an aerobatic display team organized by pilots of the 720th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, flying four F-86F Sabres. The team's demonstrations were limited to just the state of Alaska and was ended in 1955 when the 720th FBS was re-designated as the 455th Fighter-Bomber Squadron.In the mid-1950s, there was an \"Acrojets\" team under the command of USAFE (United States Air Force in Europe) in Germany, this one made up of USAF T-33 Shooting Star instructor pilots.  This team was disbanded in 1957.Another aerial demonstration team established in the mid-1950s was the \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\"  \u2013 only this was a group of four C-130 pilots (and their planes, of course) - officially recognized as an aerial demonstration team by the USAF's Tactical Air Command in 1957.  They flew as an aerial demonstration team until 1960.The \"Minute Men\" were the Air National Guard's official demonstration team.  The team began in 1947 from the 120th Fighter Squadron of the Colorado Air National Guard and performed with the P-51 until the pilots were needed for combat missions in Korea.  After the pilots had returned, the 120th had received the F-80C Shooting Stars, and the team was re-formed in 1953.  However, it wasn\u2019t until 1957 that the \"Minute Men\" were designated as the official Jet Precision Demonstration Team for the Air National Guard of the United States \u2013 and soon afterward the team received a C-47 support cargo plane and permanent mechanics as the official aerobatic display team and in 1958 converted to the F-86F Sabre in 1958.  In 1959 the team was disbanded, for budgetary reasons.In 1952, the \"Guardian Angels\" demonstration team was formed from pilots of 104th Fighter Squadron from the Maryland Air National Guard. This team performed using the P-51H Mustang and was disbanded in 1953.Predating the USAF, but still part of the legacy of its aerial demonstration teams:\u201cThree Musketeers\u201d \u2013 the first US aerobatic team, formed in late 1927.  The team flew the Boeing PW-9 fighter craft.  In 1928, the team was disbanded.\u201cThree Men on the Flying Trapeze\u201d \u2013 an aerobatic display team was organized at the US Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama in 1932, flying P-12 pursuit planes.  In essence, this team was the Three Musketeers re-constituted.  The team was disbanded in 1936.The \"Skylarks\" - a demonstration team from US Army Air Corps at Maxwell Field, Alabama, created in 1935.  The team flew Boeing P-12E pursuit fighters and was disbanded in 1937."}

{"title": "How to Get a Bad-Credit Personal Loan", "text": "Bad credit can leave you feeling as if you have few borrowing options just when you need them the most. However, being a high-risk borrower does not necessarily mean that bad credit and payday loans are the only choices you have for getting a personal loan. Although a low credit score, which according to Credit.org is any score below about 620, will equate to a higher interest rate, you have the option of qualifying with a traditional lender for a personal loan.\n\nA credit union may be more willing to consider more than just your credit score.\n\ncredit: Ivelin Radkov/iStock/Getty Images\n\nChoose the Right Lender\n\nQualifying scores and credit requirements vary among lenders and financial institutions. The trick is to find one that considers your character in addition to your credit score. According to Debt.org, a credit union is a good place to start. Unlike a for-profit commercial bank, a credit union is a nonprofit organization owned by its members. Not only do most credit unions actively seek new borrowers, but if you find one you have something in common with, such as an affiliation with your employer or your profession, you can improve your chances of qualifying for a personal loan.\n\nDo Not Ask for Too Much\n\nConsider what you need the loan for and how much you really need. According to First Financial, an online lender, you can improve your chances of qualifying by asking for the least amount you need. Most applications ask what you plan to do with the proceeds. You might have a better shot at getting a loan for debt consolidation than if you plan to spend it for a vacation.\n\nApply for a Secured Loan\n\nLeveraging personal assets such as a percentage of the equity in your home or a vehicle might help you qualify for a personal loan and reduce the interest rate. In fact, First Financial says that if you offer good collateral, some lenders may not even consider your credit score. If pledging your home or car makes you uncomfortable or isn't possible, Nolo recommends that you open a certificate of deposit or savings account and offer the account as collateral.\n\nConsider a Peer-to-Peer Personal Loan\n\nPeer-to-peer lending, also known as social lending, is a nontraditional online lending option in which you borrow from an individual rather than a financial institution. Although P2P lenders do charge a percentage of the amount you borrow as a loan origination fee, they report payments to all three major credit-reporting agencies. Also, according to LendingMemo, a P2P informational site, benefits include higher approval rates, lower interest rates, no prepayment penalties and the option to qualify for a larger loan than you would with a traditional bank. Research options at websites such as the Lending Club and Prosper."}

We noticed that cars were either unadorned, or had bumper stickers that could not be removed. In fact, we didn\u2019t place bumper stickers on our cars for this reason. Therefore, we set out to design and manufacture stylish and decorative removable magnets. We also worked with the kids to find a way to give back: since driving cars doesn\u2019t help the environment, we all decided to do something help the environment. So, the company donates a portion of the proceeds from each magnet to non-profit organizations that offset carbon emissions.\u201d\nNW: How is your family involved in the business?

{"title": "8 Tips To Find a Great Used Car", "text": "Find a cared-for used car at a bargain 1 of 9  Gently used cars can be great deals. They can be new enough to have all the toys and safety features. But they\u2019re also old enough that someone else has taken the hit for a big chunk of the car\u2019s depreciation. And, after a few years, you probably know most of the problems associated with that make and model. So, you\u2019re going into the decision well-informed, with your eyes wide open. But these days, with frequent recalls, buyers also may feel like their quest is a bit of a minefield. In the market for a good used car? Here are 8 tips for getting a good one. Previous Next\nNarrow your search 2 of 9\n Shopping for a used car is \u201cjust like buying a new car. (It) starts with the research,\u201d says Jeff Bartlett, deputy editor of autos at Consumer Reports. From that, create a target list of cars (make, model and year), that suit your needs, he says. That means looking at gas mileage (check the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s FuelEconomy.gov) and safety and handling tests (2 good checks: the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at SaferCar.gov and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety at IIHS.org). The big difference with newer cars: Instead of looking at 1 or 2 model years, you have a larger pool to choose from, Bartlett says. If you\u2019re buying a used car, check out the car loan rates at Bankrate.com before shopping. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll often find is a car may have had problems 1 year that have been addressed\u201d in subsequent years, he says. Also, you should make certain you\u2019re comparing the same features on the car models that you\u2019re interested in, Bartlett says. If you like the safety ratings on a particular model, make sure the car you\u2019re considering has all of the same safety equipment. With some older models, safety features that are now standard like side air bags may have been optional when the car was made, Bartlett says. That can make a big difference in safety and crash performance. Previous Next\nOpt for newer, rather than older 3 of 9\n Once you\u2019ve targeted specific makes and models, check general prices against your budget and opt for the newest versions of cars that you can afford, says Jack Nerad, executive market analyst at KBB.com and author of \u201cThe Complete Idiot\u2019s Guide to Buying or Leasing a Car.\u201d With used cars, \u201cyou\u2019re better off with a newer model rather than an older model,\u201d he says. \u201cThe very simple reason is that cars get better every year.\u201d Typically, the newer models \u201cwill have the most recent equipment all the way around,\u201d Nerad says. Previous Next\nResearch any car model recalls 4 of 9\n You will want to review any recalls of models that you\u2019re targeting before you start. Cars can be on a recall list for major or minor defects, says Jack Gillis, author of \u201cThe Car Book\u201d and spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America. Once you locate individual cars that you\u2019re considering, you can go to SaferCar.gov, put in the VIN (vehicle identification number) and see what recalls have been issued on that specific model, Gillis says. There are 2 things worth knowing. First, if a manufacturer has issued a recall, their dealerships will fix the problem for free \u2013 whether you bought it new or used, says Bartlett. Second, with most recalls there are sufficient parts and labor to fix recall problems, Gillis says. But with some larger recalls, there may be a waiting list. That\u2019s also true of some of the newer recalls that involve problems like ignition switches or air bags, he says. And the prospect of buying a recalled car and not being able to get it fixed before you drive it is a good reason to opt for a different model instead. Previous Next\nBuy from friends or family 5 of 9\n A used car is not the type of thing you want to buy from a total unknown \u2013 no matter how good that deal. Gillis recommends 2 sources: people you know or dealerships. \u201cThe key to finding a good used car is to know as much about its history as possible,\u201d he says. Since that can be tough, he recommends buying from someone you know, if you\u2019re not going through a dealer. No matter the car\u2019s price, you\u2019ll want the best car loan for the money, and you\u2019ll find that at Bankrate.com. If your dad or father-in-law is getting ready to trade a car, and you know and like its history, that might be the used car for you. So let close friends and family know that you\u2019re looking for a good used car. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people will get back to you and say, \u2018yeah, we\u2019re going to sell our car.\u2019 And, they\u2019re in the best possible position to tell you their experience with the vehicle,\u201d Gillis says. Unlike a total stranger, you\u2019re going to be bumping into them regularly, so there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019ll be honest with you, he says. Plus, if you know them, you already should have a general idea of their history with the car. Previous Next\nCheck out the auto dealership lots 6 of 9\n The other outlet for a good car: a car dealership. \u201cDealers tend to keep the good cars they get from trades and get rid of the ones they think are problematic,\u201d the Consumer Federation\u2019s Gillis says. So, the cars on dealers\u2019 lots can be solid options. \u201cOne tip is that it\u2019s always good to buy a used car of the same brand that the dealer sells, because they have access to any needed repairs less expensively than if the car was from another brand,\u201d Gillis says. On the other hand, if you buy one brand from another brand\u2019s dealership, \u201coften they will give you a very good price for it because it\u2019s not a vehicle they\u2019re familiar with,\u201d he says. Previous Next\nGet a warranty and take a lengthy test drive 7 of 9\n Dealers also can offer you something your best friend can\u2019t \u2014 a warranty. Depending on the used car and its age, you\u2019ll either get the remainder of the manufacturer\u2019s warranty or a 30-, 60- or 90-day warranty from the dealership, Gillis says. And often the powertrain \u2013 everything from the transmission to the engine to the components that make the wheels turn \u2013 can be warrantied for \u201cas long as 2 years,\u201d he says. Whether you\u2019re buying a truck or a car, check out the auto loan rates at Bankrate.com before shopping. Want to buy yourself a little bit of insurance? Skip those \u201cas-is\u201d deals, Gillis says. Many automakers also have certified pre-owned car programs. That means \u201csomeone has gone through the vehicle, and there\u2019s a good chance that a vehicle that makes it through this process will be free of problems,\u201d he says. By itself \u201cit\u2019s not a guarantee; it\u2019s not a perfect system,\u201d says Gillis. But it is one more step toward getting a good deal on a good car. KBB.com\u2019s Nerad suggests that you also take a lengthy test drive or two. Unlike a new car, each used car was \u201cowned by somebody different than the one next to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has had different maintenance done to it. It\u2019s essentially become a one-off.\u201d \u201cThat test drive\u2019s important,\u201d Nerad says. Previous Next\nGet a car history report 8 of 9\n Car history reports can be helpful for used car buyers, Consumer Reports\u2019 Bartlett says. If you\u2019re buying from an individual, you or the seller can buy an auto history report for less than $50. And more and more dealers are offering them for free, says Gillis. Bartlett says you also can get a free theft check through the National Insurance Crime Bureau. But auto history reports are not perfect and may not include everything about a car\u2019s past, Gillis says. If that vehicle has never been reported as a flood car, or a car that\u2019s been totaled or a stolen car, that won\u2019t be listed on the car\u2019s history, he says. So, while car history reports can be very helpful, you want to use them in conjunction with an independent inspection, Gillis says. Previous Next"}

If so, get preapproved\nA large chunk of buyers don't bother getting preapproved for a home loan, which is a mistake. Many real estate agents won't look your way if you don't have clearance from your bank.\nThe purpose of a preapproval is to determine how much you're eligible to borrow.\n\"(Potential buyers) need to assess their own financial ability, and a good way to do that is to seek preapproval from a qualified lender,\" says Sandra O'Connor, a regional vice president for the National Association of Realtors in North Carolina.\nAs a rule of thumb, it's possible that you'd qualify for a mortgage that is 2 1/2 to 3 times your gross annual income, O'Connor says.\nFor example, if you earn $55,000 annually, you could be approved for a loan in the $137,500 to $165,000 range.\nYou don't need a 20% down payment. Still, the more you put down the better\nPart of understanding the mortgage options available to you is being aware of your down payment options, Chrane says. \"There are just a lot of people that don't even know those options exist.\"\nIt's possible to buy a home with less than a 20% down payment, but pony up as much cash as you can.\n\"The more money (you) have to invest in (your) purchase, the better off the process will go and the greater (your) equity will be,\" O'Connor says.\nThere are resources available to help make homeownership more affordable, Chrane says. A good place to start is by reaching out to your state's housing finance agency.\nFactor in your lifestyle when you're looking for a home\nDon't go blindly into the house-hunting process, advises Marty Gruer, senior director of national homeownership programs and lending at NeighborWorks America in Washington, D.C. Figure out your needs as a potential homeowner.\n\"What is critical for (you) to have this property now at this point in (your) life?\" Gruer asks.\nFor starters, decide which type of home you want to buy: a single-family dwelling, condo or town house. Consider the expenses that are likely to come up -- aside from your mortgage payment -- such as homeowners association fees and maintenance.\n\"Feel comfortable in shopping around and becoming as informed a buyer as possible,\" Gruer says.\nYou should also think about where you and your family spend your time, such as at work, school or any recreational activities, and buy a home that is in close proximity to those places, O'Connor adds.\nIs your credit mortgage-ready?

I have a car loan for a vehicle that is worth less than $15,000, and I have 1 year remaining with a balance of less than $5,000. My attorney recommends I not reaffirm. Do you agree, or is it better for me to reaffirm this debt?\n-- Stitch Dear Stitch,\nYour attorney gives good advice. I am not a fan of reaffirming a car loan after you file bankruptcy. If you are able to continue making payments on the vehicle without a reaffirmation agreement, you will eventually get the title to the car in about a year. A reaffirmation agreement is a legal, enforceable contract, filed with the bankruptcy court, which states your promise to repay all or a portion of a debt that may otherwise have been subject to discharge in your bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy cancels your legal liability to pay on the car. When you sign a reaffirmation agreement, you are re-establishing that liability. This does not mean that you can keep the car, not make payments and receive the car title. That would be too easy. The reaffirmation agreement re-establishes liability otherwise eliminated in the bankruptcy. And failing to make payments means the car will be repossessed, sold and you will be liable for any remaining balance. This is exactly what happens when you don't file bankruptcy, have a car repossessed, get sued and must pay the remaining balance. Unfortunately, the majority -- about 65% -- of car lenders make a reaffirmation agreement mandatory as a condition of keeping the car. This means that you will not be able to choose whether you want to sign the reaffirmation agreement. Failing to complete the reaffirmation will allow the lender to repossess the vehicle after your bankruptcy is completed. If that does happen, you will not be liable for the remaining balance because you did not reaffirm the loan. Benefits of the reaffirmation: I don't think there are many benefits to signing a reaffirmation. However, there are a few:"}
{"title": "How to Set Up Outlook to Send Messages as Texts", "text": "If you're going to use Outlook to text message certain emails to your cell phone, it needs to be left on, and any previewing of messages by anti-spam software should be off for this purpose. In other words, anything that interrupts the receipt of the message and the application of the rule would stop the process. Most anti-spam software doesn't interfere with this, and some lets you set it to ignore emails that have certain characteristics.The steps to set Outlook to check messages automatically are below.1. Click on the Tools tab at the top.2. Select Options.3. Click on the Mail Setup tab.4. Click on the Send/Receive tab.5. Click the box next to \"Schedule an automatic send/receive every...\" box and set the minutes you want.6. Click on Close and OK and you're finished.Why Send Emails as Text Messages?Why would you want to have emails go out to people as text messages rather than just forwarded as emails. First, even though the time estimates vary, all surveys done have shown that people read their text messages MUCH sooner than they do their emails. If a message is time sensitive, it is clear that a text will get read much sooner.While just about everyone uses SMS text messaging, many do not check their email on their phones.  Some consider it an office or desk activity. They just do not see an email as time sensitive as a text message. A text message can also easily be forwarded, so if a husband and wife need to know about a closing time change, they can text it back and forth.In today's world, texting has taken the place of voice calls in the younger generations, so using it in business going forward is a good idea.Setting a Rule in Outlook to Forward Messages as TextsNow you need to decide which emails are important enough to have them sent automatically to your cell phone as text messages. Since Outlook is automatically checking email you need to tell it which ones to process with an Outlook Rule.You might want to just have the emails of a certain client or clients forwarded, or one idea would be to tell clients to enter something like \"Text Jim\" in the subject to get the email to you quickly. Another way, if you have the capability, is to have another special email address set up like \"client@yourdomain.com\" or \"urgent@yourdomain.com\". This way you can have all emails to this address only sent to your phone.Steps to set this up are below.We're setting up a rule to send messages from a certain person to the cell phone, so go to one of their emails and right-click on it. Select the Create Rule option.Note that the first screen already has the box checked to process this rule for this person's emails that you've received. Click on Next.The next box is where you select the option \"forward it to people or distribution list\". Click that box and then at the bottom click on the link \"people or distribution list\".Enter the text message address of your phone in the To: box at the bottom, as in 5555551212@vtext.com. Click Next, click Next again to skip the next step.Name your rule, make sure the \"Turn on Rule\" box is checked and click on Finished.Is Outlook the Right Tool?I quit using Outlook in favor of Gmail a while back. It's just better, more friendly, more easily searchable and the ways in which I can set up labels and filters (rules) are much more powerful and friendly. There are also thousands of third-party applications that work with Gmail that help me in CRM, Customer Relationship Management and marketing. Gmail and Chrome together give me even more capabilities in running my business. Then with Evernote's clipper allowing clipping emails to notebooks, all is well."}
{"title": "Real Estate 101: What&#39;s the Difference Between Dual and Single Agency?", "text": "Buyers and sellers of real estate are often confused about the role of real estate agents, whom the agents represent and real estate agency relationships. Many states require that agents give buyers and sellers an agency disclosure form to sign.This form is not an agreement; it is a disclosure. It disclosures the various natures of possible agency relationships, and it is important that you read it to be better prepared to select the type of agency relationship you want.Single AgencyBuying agents who represent buyers are working in a single agency capacity as a buyer's agent. Seller's agents who represent sellers are working in a single agency capacity as a listing agent.Agents who represent clients under single agency owe a fiduciary responsibility to the client. They cannot share confidential information with the other party or the other party's agent. Single agency agents must use care and due diligence to perform duties, disclose all material facts and be honest.Buyer's agents and the buyer generally sign a buyer's broker agreement, which lays out the duties and obligations of the agent. In some states, if buyers do not sign a buyer's broker agreement with the agent, that agent does not represent the buyer but instead becomes a sub-agent of the seller. Sub-agents owe the same duties to the seller as the listing agent.Seller's agents and the seller sign a listing agreement, which also lays out the duties and obligations of the agent. Listing agents and buyer's agents each owes the client loyalty, confidentiality and accountability.Many agents work as buyer's agent with buyers and as a seller's agent with sellers. However, some agents work solely as exclusive buyer's agents and never, ever take a listing.Dual Agency With Two AgentsBecause all real estate agents are licensed under a real estate broker, it is possible to work with one agent who is licensed by the same broker as the listing agent. This situation creates a dual agency. The agents could work at separate offices and be strangers to each other, but since they are licensed by the broker, they are still operating under dual agency if one agent represents the buyer and the other represents the seller.Starting out, an agent may have created an single agency relationship with the buyer, but when the buyer chooses a home listed by that agent's broker, the agent's relationship with the buyer changes. Not all single agents note the distinction. In the real world, most of these dual agents talk the talk of dual agency but continue to walk the walk of single-agency representation.Dual agency must be agreed to in writing between the parties. Laws vary from state to state. In California, for example, exclusive buyer's broker agreements contain verbiage that allows dual agency, so most buyers don't realize their buyer's broker could be subject to dual agency. Only exclusive buyer's agents are never dual agents.Dual Agency With Same AgentA listing agent who also represents the buyer is a dual agent. Dual agents cannot operate in a fiduciary relationship with either party and must treat both sellers and buyers equally. They cannot share confidential information but they cannot give confidential advice.A dual agent in California was sued by the seller because she told the buyer to ask for a carpet allowance from the seller. It is very difficult to obtain the highest and best price for the seller when the agent also represents the buyer. The dual agent cannot advise on home price nor terms nor negotiate on anyone's behalf.Some buyers prefer to work solely with listing agents because they know the agent is receiving both ends of the commission, that is the listing commission and the buyer's agent commission. They feel the listing agent is motivated when a buyer makes a purchase offer to get that offer accepted. They might also ask the dual agent to further negotiate the real estate commission to increase the seller's profit on a low-ball offer.Transaction AgentsTo avoid dual agency, some agents will work as transaction agents. Transaction agents do not represent either party and do not protect the interest of the seller nor the buyer. They simply facilitate the transaction.A transaction agent helps to fulfill the obligations of the purchase contract and provides the necessary paperwork for each side. It relieves some of the responsibility incurred when agents take on dual agency and further removes the agent from loyalty.At the time of writing, Elizabeth Weintraub, DRE # 00697006, is a Broker-Associate at Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, California."}
{"title": "How to Start a Horse Supply Business for Owners, Trainers and Breeders", "text": "Tack shops provide quality saddles and supplies to horse owners, trainers, and breeders.Industry ExperienceIf you are interested in starting a tack shop business, you should have a strong background in some area of the equine industry. Those with previous retail experience will find it to be particularly beneficial, especially if this work experience was gained in an equine or animal related store environment.The customers that visit your store will value your expert opinion regarding the tack and equipment that you sell, so it is important that you are familiar with the various disciplines of equestrian competition and the specific items utilized in these pursuits. It is best to work for an established store (even if it is only briefly) before venturing out on your own, as there is no substitute for hands-on experience.Business Considerations for a Tack ShopBefore opening your tack shop, you must take into account the variety of business and legal considerations that tie into starting a new business. Schedule a consultation with your accountant regarding the advantages and disadvantages of forming your business as a sole proprietorship, Limited Liability Company (LLC), corporation, or another type of entity.You should also contact your state or local government to look into any requirements, such as permits or licenses, which could be necessary for your business to operate in its intended location. Securing an insurance policy should also be on the planning checklist.LocationMost tack shops have a brick and mortar retail store location, as horse owners like to purchase their tack and supplies in person if a shop with competitive prices is nearby. Many riders prefer to sit in various saddles to find the one that is the most comfortable for their use before making an investment in this expensive piece of tack.A retail location carries with it the added expense of a lease unless you have your own property which would be suitable for construction of a new building or renovation of an existing structure.Some brick and mortar tack shops maintain a website to allow out of town customers to place orders. There are also tack shops that operate exclusively through websites and do not have physical retail locations.Mobile tack shops have been growing in popularity in recent years. A mobile tack shop is operated out of a large trailer which can be towed to horse shows and other equine events. Some tack shop operators use these mobile units to travel the show or race circuits to supply competitors who are on the road.Product InventoryMost shops carry a variety of tack items which can include saddles, bridles, blankets, saddle pads, halters, lead shanks, martingales, breastplates, and girths. Some shops also offer engraving services to customize brass nameplates used on halters, saddles, and belts.Tack shops also routinely carry equine supplies and equipment such as brushes, leg wraps, buckets, tools, riding apparel (such as boots or helmets), tack trunks, feed, liniments, supplements, and treats. They may also stock gift items such as key chains, model horses, stuffed animals, and other equine gifts. Some shops also choose to sell quality used tack or apparel on a consignment basis.Advertising & MarketingSome shops allow customers to sign up for a weekly or monthly newsletter that will inform them of upcoming sales and specials.Another way to gain exposure is through sponsorships of horse shows, races, or other equine events. Sponsors are frequently granted the privilege of selling their merchandise on site, so this can be a great way to gain access to potential customers. Making donations to charity auctions can also draw positive attention to your business while helping a good cause.Tack shops may also advertise by sending out mailings, visiting equestrian centers, placing custom magnets on company vehicles, and creating hats or clothing featuring the business logo.Tack shops can also benefit from referral business directed their way by equine veterinarians, farriers, barn managers, and trainers. Positive word of mouth references from happy customers can also be a great advertisement for a tack shop."}
{"title": "Hearing Aids Might Prevent Dementia", "text": "senior living\nTo reduce their risk of dementia, consider buying your parents hearing aids\n Researchers have known for years that hearing loss seems to increase the risk of dementia. Now there's evidence that hearing aids can mitigate that risk. Hearing aids stave off dementia A French study that followed thousands of older people for 25 years recently found that hearing aids seem to protect against cognitive decline. People who used the assistive devices experienced memory issues at about the same rate as those without any hearing loss. That's huge news for seniors and their families, since an investment in hearing aids could help stave off, or at least delay, some of the massive caregiving costs associated with Alzheimer's and dementia. The Alzheimer's Association estimates the cost of caring for patients in the U.S. was $226 billion in 2015. Medicare and Medicaid are expected to pay $154 billion in 2015 caring for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Pay now or later The problem is that hearing aids aren't cheap -- they typically cost $2,000 to $3,000 apiece -- and they're not covered by Medicare or most private insurance.\n\"When Medicare was created in the 1960s, hearing loss was thought to be an inevitable part of aging,\" said Dr. Charlotte Yeh, chief medical officer for AARP Services Inc. \"Why would you cover something that's inevitable?\"\nSince then, studies have demonstrated the link between hearing loss and cognitive decline. One research project in 2011 found that those with moderate hearing loss had triple the risk of dementia as those with normal hearing.\nHearing loss contributes dramatically to other problems that also are associated with dementia, including social isolation and depression, Yeh said.\nHearing loss contributes to falls\nHearing loss also significantly increases the risk of falling, a leading cause of death for people over 65. Even a mild degree of hearing impairment tripled the risk of accidental tumbles in a study by researchers from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the National Institute of Aging, and the risk increased 140% for every 10 decibels of hearing loss.\nPeople wait too long\nBut untreated hearing loss is the norm. Only 20% of those with hearing loss seek treatment, and hearing aid users typically wait over 10 years to get fitted with the devices. By that point, they may have permanently lost some of their ability to distinguish sounds, even with aids.\n\"It becomes far more difficult to learn to use hearing aids,\" Yeh said. \"That's why I think early testing is important and why early use of hearing devices makes sense.\"\nSome possibilities for lowering the cost include:\nVeterans Administration. Veterans can get a free hearing evaluation from an audiologist. Those diagnosed as needing hearing assistance will get hearing aids, repairs and batteries at no cost.\nFederal employee benefits. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers up to $2,500 in hearing aid costs.\nOther insurance. Some plans offer partial coverage or discounts with contracted providers. Only 3 states -- Arkansas, New Hampshire and Rhode Island -- mandate hearing aid coverage for adults.\nLoans. Many states offer \"assistive technology\" loan programs through the RESNA Alternative Financing and Telework Technical Assistance Project, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Education. CareCredit is another option, offering a credit card for health care services."}

{"title": "What Happens If You File As Single If You Are Married?", "text": "Federal income tax rules are copious and complex, but tax filers must adhere to them in order to avoid penalties. One key area where tax filers must present truthful information is in the category of marital status. If an individual who is married files his taxes as a single person, he could face serious consequences. But the law does provide for some exceptions.\n\nFiling as single when you are married is illegal and carries stiff penalties.\n\nPenalty\n\nUnder Title 26, section 7206(1) of the United States Code, anyone who knowingly and willfully misrepresents any part of a tax return is guilty of felony perjury. A person who files as single when she is actually married falls into this category. If the Internal Revenue Service discovers the deception, the guilty party could be charged and convicted. If convicted, the filer could face up to three years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 for individuals ($500,000 for corporations) or a combination of the two.\n\nSingle Filing Status Categories\n\nIf you are not legally married, you must file as single, head of household or qualifying widow/widower. A single filer is an individual who does not have dependents and cannot be considered legally married in any state or territory by the last day of the tax year. A person filing as head of a household is unmarried, has paid more than half of the cost of upkeep of a household and has qualifying dependents (children, parents and other relatives living in the household). A qualifying widow/widower with dependent children must have had a spouse who died within two years of the current tax year, must have been qualified to file as married filing jointly in the year that the spouse died and must have custody of a child or stepchild by the deceased spouse.\n\nMarried Filing Status Categories\n\nYou may file as married filing separately or married filing jointly if you have been married for at least the entire year prior to the year in which you are filing. You are considered legally married by the Internal Revenue Service only if you meet one of the following criteria: you and your spouse have been living as husband and wife for the last year; you and your spouse are in a common-law marriage that is recognized by your current state or the state of origin of the marriage; or you are married and living separately, but not legally separated or you are legally separated by interlocutory decree that is not final.\n\nPossible Exceptions\n\nYou are not in violation of the law if you did not knowingly and willfully file as single when you were married. This situation could occur if you attempted to have an annulment or divorce in the previous tax year and you had reason to believe that the annulment or divorce was legal, but it was not. You may be able to present a case in your defense if you have evidence that the court handling the annulment or divorce was negligence in executing its duties."}
{"title": "How to Succeed with Your Big Presentation to the Executives", "text": "An invitation to present your ideas or your proposal to the executive management team is a great opportunity to make a positive impression on the people who have a voice in your future. If this is your first time presenting to this group, it pays to know your audience and set yourself up for success with proper planning.6 Things You Should Know About Executives1. They appreciate well-prepared presentations. Executives appreciate discovering intelligent new voices in the business and they will be paying close attention to you. Come prepared to deliver.2. You\u2019re always on the clock when you are in front of executives. While they\u2019re interested in what you have to say, their attention spans are short. Use your allotted time carefully.   3. Don't assume you're pitching to a team. We tend to think of them as the \u201cexecutive team\u201d however, they are better described as a collection of smart, successful functional experts who come together from time-to-time to engage on the big issues facing the business. Roughly translated, if you\u2019re selling them on a new proposal, you will have to sell them one at a time.4. Know their hot-buttons. Executives focus on costs, returns and trade-offs. While you might be excited about the incredible benefits your new program offers for customers, they\u2019re thinking: \u201cHow much will this cost?\u201d Or, \u201cWhat will I have to give up to support this initiative?\u201d5. Executives love data-driven discussions and recommendations. They\u2019ll descend upon your numbers outlining costs and returns like a pack of hungry wolves. However, if you bring questionable or confusing data to the meeting, it is possible you will lose an extremity.6. Executives are always hunting for great talent. Emphasis on \u201calways.\u201d Work hard to make a great impression.12 Tips to Make a Great First ImpressionPut these tips to work and your odds of success improve dramatically.1. Carefully construct, support, and practice your message. A simple technique for distilling your message down to its component parts is: message mapping.Draw a circle in the center of a sheet of paper. This is your core message. It should be no longer than one or two sentences. Yes, it\u2019s difficult to distill your message down to a few brief sentences, but you must. The time invested now will pay dividends in your live presentation.Surround your core message with three or, at most, four additional circles. Fill these in with the primary data points that support your core message. This might be market research, customer feedback, competitor data, or your own projections. If needed, go just one layer deeper and attach supporting data for the supporting data.Learn to use this message map in both directions. Describe your core message and supporting points, or describe a supporting point and connect it to your core message. The map works in both directions. Practice it like a politician preparing for a debate.2. Ensure that your message focuses on opportunity development or burden relief. Executives are interested in strengthening their ability to compete for and retain customers, and reduce costs. Make certain your value proposition is tight.3. Do not sugarcoat risks in your presentation. On the contrary, a well-developed list of potential risks and a risk mitigation strategy show the executives that you are thinking about everything.4. Carefully prepare meaningful, simple visuals. Have several people\u2014including your boss\u2014review them for quality, clarity, and completeness. Now is not the time for animation magic. Make certain that the visuals use text sparingly and numbers carefully.5. Mentally divide your time allotment in half. Know how much time you have been allocated and plan to use only half of it. 6. Bring it! Executives look for confidence, clarity, and completeness of thought when listening to the ideas and proposals from employees. Your message and your body language must support the notion that you are confident about your ideas.7. The harder you work, the more relaxed you will be. Practice your presentation until it is natural. Your confidence will be contagious. 8. If you are uncomfortable presenting, fix-it in a hurry. Chances are it\u2019s too late to seek formal training or coaching, so, recruit a buddy you trust to offer critical feedback and run through the presentation with him/her. Avoid this in the future by signing up for speaking training or joining a local Toastmasters group. 9. Leverage a subtle power move. If possible, grab a marker and get to the whiteboard. This is a presentation power-tip. By doing this, you involve and engage the audience and showcase your confidence and expertise.10. When it comes to questions, remember the message map. If you put the time in to crafting a thorough message map, it is the go-to source for answering questions. Reiterate supporting data and always tie the data to the core message.  If you do not know an answer to a question, do not make the answer up. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d is perfectly acceptable, especially when it is followed by, \u201cBut I will find out and loop back with the team immediately.\u201d11. Passion for your topic is a positive. Executives love to hear and feel the passion in your presentation. If you believe in something, make certain you use all of your faculties to communicate your commitment. Your passion for your project is impressive and contagious.12. No surprises please. If your request involves resources or budgets from multiple groups within the firm, the executive presentation is not the time to spring this as a surprise. Work ahead of your presentation to line-up support from your counterparts in other departments.The Bottom-Line for NowWe all know you only get one chance to make a first impression.

The ads promise that you won't be turned down, regardless of your health.\nBut if you're looking for a quick net-worth boost at death's door or a last-minute cash windfall for your heirs, don't count on a guaranteed-issue product.\n\"For the first two years, the death benefits are minimal,\" Hasenauer says. \"That two-year window is the suicide period, the contestability window where the company would contest that the information you provided was not correct.\"\nThe benefits may step up after the contestability period, but not by much. \"They're not very big policies; you could never go and get a good estate planning-type policy,\" she says. \"They're pretty close to burial-type policies -- just enough to get you in the ground and pay the minister.\"\nThe cost of these policies reflects their increased risk to the insurer. \"They're crazy expensive,\" says Steuer. \"And statistically, less than 10 percent of people will qualify for the best available rates that are offered by insurance companies.\"\nIf you're considering a guaranteed-issue product, the experts recommend that you shop around.\nNo. 2: Agents always disclose their commission\nWant to know exactly how much commission your agent is making on your life insurance policy?\nGood luck finding out.\n\"It's a real quagmire,\" says Steuer. \"Life insurance is the last financial industry where compensation is not fully disclosed.\"\nThat's by design. The insurance industry has long maintained that divulging the commission on whole life -- which Hunt says can typically run 85 percent of first-year premiums with annual renewal commissions of 7 percent for the next decade -- could kill the sale.\nDespite this dated defense, disclosure is already required overseas.\n\"It's something that is going to catch on more and more in the (U.S.) life insurance industry,\" Steuer says.\nUntil it does, Hunt suggests two workarounds:\nCompare the first-year surrender value to the first-year premium. The closer the surrender value is to zero dollars, the more money is going into the agent's pocket. There's just one catch: You need to purchase the policy to get this information.\nGet a competing quote from TIAA-CREF, which sells direct policies without commissions. This will give you a rough idea of how much commission your policy contains.\nNo. 3: Life insurance is a good investment\nLife insurance, a good investment? Total fantasy, says Steuer.\n\"I liken life insurance to the casino industry,\" he says. \"How do you think they get these big, flashy buildings and these solid financials? Not by giving you this really great deal.\"\nEach decade, the industry seems to dream up another sound financial reason for you to \"invest\" in life insurance. In the 1980s, it was the tax advantage of single-premium life policies, which quickly evaporated when the wealthy started flocking to them as tax havens.\nHunt predicts the current sales pitch touting the tax deferral on the cash value buildup within permanent life policies will turn out to be just wishful thinking for many.\n\"The problem is, 40 (percent) or 50 percent of the buyers drop out within 10 years and never get a good return on their money,\" says Hunt. His recommendation? Buy term life insurance and stick the savings in your 401(k) instead.\nNext time you hear the siren song of life insurance \"investing,\" Steuer says tune it out.\n\"Insurance is insurance; it's not an investment vehicle,\" he says.\nNo. 4: Medical underwriting is just a formality\nYes, life insurers like to downplay the medical exam , and for good reason: They don't want you to know how seriously they take your health.\n\"If you're buying a million-dollar policy, you're going to go through a full medical exam by a doctor of the insurer's choice,\" Hasenauer says.\nThis information is collected by MIB Group, an insurance industry trade group, and insurers use it to assess your risk. \"As we go down the scale to smaller and smaller policies, we get policies that are written with questionnaires only and then they go to the MIB and get additional information there,\" she says.\nIf you've ever applied for any insurance as a smoker, or if you use any nicotine products including a patch, you'll likely wind up in the smoker pool, even when you qualify for Medicare. Heck, some cancer survivors have a better chance of favorable rates than smokers do.\n\"There's a reason for it: It's costly!\" Hasenauer says.\nDon't try to hide it. \"That's a misrepresentation that could put your insurance policy in jeopardy,\" she says.\nNo. 5: Working with many agents saves money\nShould you shop for your life insurance through one agent or several?\nWhile situations vary, Steuer recommends working with one agent or broker who writes for a dozen or more companies, especially if you have health issues.\n\"Some companies just won't touch cancer patients; other companies will consider them on a case-by-case basis or they'll consider cancer survivors,\" he says. \"Then sometimes there's a competitive advantage where your agent will say, 'Company A is willing to go standard (rates) on this. Will you consider going standard on it as well?' and set up a negotiation.\"\nWhat about using several agents? \"It doesn't work out well because then you have to interpret all the stuff that you're getting from the agents rather than hiring an expert to sort through it,\" he says.\nThat said, your home-auto insurer may not be a bad choice for those who want to keep all their policies under one roof, he says.\nNo. 6: It's life insurance. You can't negotiate!\nSome life insurance agents cast themselves in the role of passive messenger, handing down the best offers from on high. Why? Because it works out to their financial advantage 99 percent of the time.\nA dedicated pro knows how to use those best offers as a first offer and dig for even better terms on your behalf.\nFor example, Hunt cites a technique called \"blending\" in which an agent will mix in some no-load or low-commission term life coverage that eventually converts to permanent insurance in order to increase the first-year surrender value of a whole life policy.\n\"If someone tries to sell you a full-commission $1 million policy with (zero dollars) surrender value in the first year, tell them you want at least 50 percent in the surrender column,\" Hunt suggests.\nBut Hasenauer cautions against letting negotiation turn into procrastination.\n\"Life insurance never gets cheaper; it's not like buying last year's iPhone. Life insurance will continually get more expensive as one ages. That's why it's important to insure now rather than later.\""}
{"title": "Gypsum separation walls provide a 2-hour fire protection", "text": "Gypsum area separation walls are lightweight, non-load bearing gypsum partition that provides fire-rated capacity typically used between adjacent walls on townhouse construction. These gypsum separation walls components are steel studs, steel tracks, two layer of gypsum liner panels and aluminum clips attached to the gypsum panel. Gypsum separation walls provide a 2-hour fire protection and also serve as noise reduction between neighboring units. These walls can be used on constructions up to four stories in height and are compatible with standard floor to ceiling heights.How It WorksIf a fire occurs in the area, the fire heat will melt the aluminum clips on that side, allowing the burning side wall to separate from the vertical fire barrier member and collapse. At the same time the vertical fire barrier panel will remain in place supported by the opposite aluminum clips that are not being exposed to the fire. This installation will prevent the fire from propagate to the adjacent wall structure on the other dwelling unit.How to Build a Fire Rated Separation WallOnce the framing has been completed in one of the townhouse unit, and before the adjacent unit is framed, at that point is that you will need to start building this wall. Normally a 2 inch thick wall is assembled at least 3/4 of an inch away from the wood framing, allowing to accommodate the fireblocking product to be installed between the floor levels.  The separation walls needs to be started at the foundation level and must go on all the way to the roof sheathing to form a parapet. The assembly needs to be connected to the framing with aluminum clips, that will allow the wall to collapse when the fire exposure on one of the sides affects the framing but will not pass to the other side for a limited time. Be sure to always verify your building codes for additional requirements and specifications on how to build these walls.Benefits of Gypsum Separation WallsGypsum area separation walls can provide several benefits, including:Thinner profile allows to have more usable spaceIdeal for lightweight commercial constructionExcellent sound attenuation characteristicsProvide STC ratings up to 50-54 when tested in accordance with ASTM E90.Reduce footing structural requirementsMeet BOCA and ICBO code requirements for area separation wallsTypically are installed floor by floor in the same sequence as the construction of the buildingEliminates the need for expensive scaffolds systems No additional trades are needed for their installationLower cost when compared to traditional masonry wallCan be installed under low temperaturesFaster installation can be achieved when compared to regular masonry walls.Can achieve a 2 hr fire protectionReduce labor and material costsDrawbacks of Gypsum Separation WallsSometimes it nos feasible to have this walls built, and such cases these are some of the restraints:Gypsum separation walls cannot be used on areas where water and sunlight will have direct impact on the panel.Openings are not allowed on gypsum separation wallsThey are not intended to be used as shear wallsThe exterior of these walls shall be protected by weather resistant materialsAvoid contact with materials having high moisture contentExterior wind load is limited to 15 psfInsulation must be installed after all building has been properly closed"}

{"title": "8 Ways to Tune Up Your Matching Gifts Program", "text": "What\u2019s better than one brownie? Two brownies.What\u2019s better than two brownies? Two expertly baked brownies.What\u2019s better than two expertly baked brownies? Two expertly baked brownies served with affection.While brownies may sound more enticing to your tongue, matching gifts represent the chance to double donations that nonprofits crave.However, a matching gift by itself is not enough. The matching gift request needs to be submitted and then followed up on by your nonprofit. Thank you notes need to be sent, donations tracked, and marketing materials created to raise matching gift awareness among new donors.Baking up an excellent matching gift program is a multistep process. Execution matters, and we\u2019ve got the expert tips to get you started.Idea #1 \u2013 Become a Matching Gift Expert.A popular opinion is that it takes 10,000 hours of doing any single task to become an expert. That\u2019s about 417 days of your life, and that does not account for sleep. How will you ever become a matching gift guru?Start with reading. There are great matching gift resources that can cut that 10,000 number down to far less. Moreover, matching gifts are not as complicated as open heart surgery or constructing a crossword puzzle, so finding great resources can make you a whiz in almost no time at all.You\u2019ll want to learn how programs vary among employers in order to raise the most money for your nonprofit. Corporate giving programs can change from year to year, as new programs appear, old ones fold, and companies alter the parameters surrounding their giving policies.Learn about companies with unique matching gift programs.Idea #2 \u2013 Identify a Matching Gift Coordinator.Matching gift fundraising is a ship, and a matching gift coordinator is the captain. She\u2019s the person who answers donor questions when they call and makes sure that fundraisers and the entire fundraising team ask donors to seek matching gifts.Internal awareness is key. Not only will a matching gift coordinator define staff roles for handling matching gifts, but she can educate your entire fundraising team about corporate giving to create a culture of matching gifts within your nonprofit.When your fundraisers and telefund callers know to request matching gifts, more donors are made aware of this form of corporate giving, and your organization will likely receive more doubled donations.It\u2019s best to arm fundraisers with a script, so they know how to ask for matching gifts. Also, track whether or not a prospect works for a matching gift company. Matching gift eligible donors might be prioritized, as they have the potential to give larger gifts.Learn more about selecting a leader and organizing a matching gift team.Idea #3 \u2013 Raise Awareness.With a dedicated matching gift team in place, it\u2019s time to raise awareness. Accepting matching gifts means little if you are not reminding donors to seek out doubled donations.Promotion comes in many flavors. For instance, you might:Discuss matching gifts in an email newsletter Add matching gift information to your email signatureCreate a dedicated matching gift webpageAdd matching gifts to your ways to give pageAnd moreIt is a good idea to create packets to share with donors when you meet them in person. While email and sharing information online seems like all the rage, many donors still appreciate either direct mail or tangible materials when they meet you in-person.Promotion can be hard work, but it\u2019s hard work that pays off in an easily recognizable way. Reach out to your most loyal donors to tell them about matching gifts. The extra phone call or letter could be well worth your while.Learn more about how to promote matching gifts.Idea #4 \u2013 Make Information Easy to Access.Submitting a matching gift might seem intimidating to a donor. Where do they find the forms? How do they submit the forms? Is this going to take a considerable amount of time?By making matching gift information as easy to access as possible, donors can learn everything they need to know in almost no time at all. When submitting requests is easy, you\u2019ll likely receive more matching gifts.Ways to make information accessible to donors:Add a matching gift widget to your website that lets donors search a database of matching gift companies and access relevant forms and information.Share information on a dedicated page, such as matching gift statistics and submission guidelines.Mail materials that educate donors about matching gifts.While a matching gift widget might be the best way to share matching gift information, there are other ways to improve the matching gift experience for nonprofits on a budget.Determine which matching gift companies are most common among donors and volunteers. Share matching gift information for those companies on a dedicated matching gift page, so donors know where to get the necessary forms and to submit their requests.Learn more about how a matching gift service can improve fundraising.Idea #5 \u2013 Follow Up with Matching Gift Forms.A donor submits her matching gift forms, but no staff member steps forward to process the request. Does the nonprofit receive any money?Just because a matching gift request is submitted does not mean that it is clear sailing for your nonprofit. Someone usually has to sign off or approve of a matching gift request in some way before a company will give the matching funds.Companies also have to send you the money. Your nonprofit should track what matching requests have been made, processed, and fulfilled, so you don\u2019t leave easy money on the table.If you do need to follow up with an unfulfilled request, it\u2019s best to do so with the employer, and not the donor. Donors have already given their time to submit requests, and bothering them to do more might predispose them to not give again.Learn about the various corporate giving programs that donors can apply for.Idea #6 \u2013 Say Thank You.Donations make your mission possible, so never forget to thank donors. Gratefulness goes a long way towards building meaningful relationships that encourage donors to give again and again.Matching gifts do more than regular donations, so your nonprofit wants to do a little more with its thank you notes. A special note for matching gift donors is a start, but you can also say thank you twice.Thank donors for their original donations, and separately for the matching gift. You want donors to know that their matching contributions were received, as they\u2019ll be more likely to give again when they know that their extra efforts paid off.Saying thank you is all about making donors feel special. Another best practice is to invite matching gift donors to an event, where you thank them for their generous contributions.It\u2019s obvious that you need to thank donors for their matching gifts, but you also need to thank the people who keep your nonprofit up to date on all things matching gifts.Company policies change, and it\u2019s hard to keep track of all the alterations. When donors reach out and inform you of a change in an employer\u2019s corporate giving policy, send the donor a thank you. These updates help your fundraisers to better focus their efforts, so they are not wasting time and resources on prospects who will give the same amounts, but without matching gifts.View thank you letter best practices.Idea #7 \u2013 Keep Records up to Date.There\u2019s nothing worse than identifying major gift prospects and then realizing that their contact information is out of date or that they switched employers and now are not eligible to give matching gifts. Either way, an outdated or poorly organized database can cause a lot of unnecessary problems.Updating donor information or finding donors with large capacities to give could be as simple as mailing out employer update cards or performing a quick prospect screening. A screening can help your nonprofit gather both contact and employer information on large groups of donors, so your fundraisers don\u2019t have to call and email everyone for updates. Screenings are also relatively fast and affordable.While updated info matters, the data needs to be organized and accessible, too. It is one thing to have a correct phone number on file, and another for a fundraiser to be able to find that phone number in a timely manner.You want to reach out to the right people, and you need to be ready to do so whenever the proper moment strikes. Powerful CRM software could be your solution for organizing your matching gift donors, as could just using better record-keeping habits.Idea #8 \u2013 Measure Your Performance.How do you know that matching gifts are worth all this time and energy? Data, of course.Categories to track matching gift program performance:How much money did you raise from matching gifts last year?What is your matching gift goal for this year?What percent of your total revenue do matching gifts account for?How much in matching gifts have you received from any single employer?What resources and costs go into acquiring matching gifts?Too many nonprofits don\u2019t do enough to track matching gifts, and that is a shame. In order to improve matching gift outreach and promotion, nonprofits need hard data to tell them what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Tracking matching gifts is all about striving to be as efficient and economical about your fundraising as possible.About one in ten donors works for a matching gift company, and more companies are offering corporate giving programs each year. Apple, one of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, didn\u2019t start offering matching gifts until 2011. We live in a rapidly changing world, and an increasingly more philanthropic world.Learn about nine companies that offer matching gift programs.Implement matching gift best practices, improve your matching gift program and reap the benefits of corporate giving like never before.How does your nonprofit handle matching gifts?"}
{"title": "8 zany tax deductions to avoid claiming", "text": "taxes\n8 zany tax deductions to avoid claiming\n<123456789> 8 zany tax deductions for 2012 Did you hear the one about the agoraphobic swimmer? The Brazilian art-supply run? The fully deductible boyfriend? The prayer room? Behold Bankrate's annual installment of the year's craziest real-life tax deductions, extracted without anesthesia from the seasonal-affective-disordered minds of some of the nation's finest Certified Public Accountants, some of whom have requested anonymity to protect the innocent. Past editions of our taxpayers-behaving-badly celebration have included such dubious deductions as pimped-out Amish buggies, souped-up breast pumps, tattooed derrieres and a full-service arsonist. As always, there's a serious message behind this mayhem: Do not try these stunts on your own tax return. The Internal Revenue Service, while generally jovial sorts, won't let laughter stop them from tossing your return into the red flag file reserved for the scofflaws, pranksters and disoriented filers among us. In the spirit of what not to claim (or what to claim with caution), we present Bankrate's eight zany tax deductions for 2012. 1. That deduction is starting to grow on me Most accountants are quick to notice when a client tries to shave a little off his or her tax bill. But Laura Cullen, a CPA in Fresno, Calif., admits even she did a double take when a new client tried to pull the hair over her eyes. \"We had a client that had been transferred to the U.S. from another country. He was an educated, likable, sharp guy,\" she recalls. \"The first year I did his personal tax return, being aware that you could itemize your medical expenses, he asked me to expense his hair transplant. I had a heck of a time explaining why I couldn't.\" 2. Friends with tax benefits The changes to the traditional American household, played for laughs on the hit TV comedy \"Modern Family,\" also make for some jaw-dropping -- and allowable -- tax deductions, according to Los Angeles forensic accountant Susan Carlisle. \"As I do most of my work in divorce, I was surprised to find that a husband, who had left the family home to live with his gay partner, (listed) both his wife and the partner, along with his children, as dependents on his tax returns in the same year prior to being officially divorced,\" she recalls. \"In all likelihood, each one -- wife, live-in boyfriend and kids -- met the definition of dependents.\" The wife and kids, sure. But the partner? It turned out the husband could claim the live-in boyfriend as a \"qualified relative\" since he: shared the same residence, was a member of the husband's household, earned less than the exemption amount ($3,700 for 2011), and derived more than half of his total support from his new partner, Carlisle says. Modern families, modern tax laws -- hey, it's complicated. 3. The agoraphobic swimmer Clients have long tried to talk Los Angeles CPA Rob Seltzer into allowing them to deduct their new swimming pools, but the strangest argument of all actually won over the IRS. \"My client was a very active individual and then incurred a severe back (and) neck injury,\" Seltzer recalls. \"After he had surgery, his doctor determined that swimming was the only form of exercise that he could do without risking further damage. In addition, if someone inadvertently collided with him while he was swimming laps, he could face reinjuring himself. So the only option that could give my client a safe form of exercise and rehabilitation was in his own lap pool. My client built the pool, a deck and a Jacuzzi, and we deducted the portion of the total cost that was attributable to the lap pool.\" That would explain the absence of a passing lane. 4. Must be quite a set of spatulas! Uncle Sam allows us to deduct the money we spend on the tools of our trade, within reason. For instance, if you have a home office, you'll likely be able to claim expenses for things such as a computer, a printer, copy paper, furnishings and a helipad. Well OK, maybe not the helipad. But Gail Rosen, a CPA in Martinsville, N.J., was blindsided by one eye-popping expense on a client's return. \"My client is a painter, and he gave us his airfare to Brazil as a deduction,\" she recalls. \"When I questioned the airfare, he said he went to Brazil to get spatulas.\" 5. The Church of Bob the Self-Ordained Tax season may cause some of us to pray for deliverance, but one taxpayer took it one step too far with this now-former CPA, who requested anonymity. \"This client was in the fitness business. As we were going through his return, he says, 'Oh, and I built a prayer room that I'd like to take as a charitable deduction.' At first I thought he was joking, like OK, we'll take the bedroom and the swing set outside, too. But he was dead serious.\" \"I said, 'Well, it's in your house, right? And you're not a minister. So unless your religion is kind of unique to you and it's a recognized charity or church, those payments come out of your own pocket.' He got quite angry when I said there's just no way, dude.\" \"It's pretty straightforward: Just because people take their shoes off when they enter doesn't make your house a temple.\" 6. I thought the room service was a little goofy! Sometimes, even paycheck deductions can be confusing -- especially if you're a professional athlete, what with all those zeroes and all. Fortunately, they have guys like Robert Raiola, a sports and entertainment CPA in Cranford, N.J., to translate for them. \"I had a guy who played for the Baltimore Orioles, and he got traded to the Anaheim Angels who, at the time, were owned by Disney, and they put him up in a Disney hotel,\" Raiola recalls. \"So he gets his first paycheck, and he calls me up all upset and says, 'Robert, there's a deduction on my paycheck for 'DIS-SUI.' I'm staying in a Disney hotel, but I'm not staying in a suite.\" \"I said, 'John, that DIS-SUI is state disability unemployment insurance.'\" 7. We won't even ask about the mileage ... We've heard of some crazy attempts to deduct cosmetic surgery over the years, but we've never come across a better counterargument than this one offered by Sean, a Dallas CPA whose saleswoman client listed a $14,000 breast enhancement as a business expense. \"I explained that this isn't a business expense. Medical expenses are on Schedule A; they're itemized deductions, and this doesn't even qualify for that because it's elective surgery,\" Sean says. \"She said, 'But that's why I spent so much money; I wanted to get the best I could!'\" \"So I said, 'Look, let's approach this like you would a car. Do you have records of when you used them for business reasons and when you used them for personal reasons? Are there maintenance fees associated with them?' She said, 'What?! I can't tell you that!' and I said, 'Exactly. And we can't write them off.'\" \"There are only one or two professions that are allowed to write those off, and there's no pole involved here,\" he added. 8. But I imagine it was delicious ... One advantage of working with CPAs is the comfort in knowing they'll have your back in the event of an IRS audit. However, there are professional guidelines that dictate just how far out on a limb your accountant is willing to climb to rescue you from the taxman. If you ever want to lose an accountant for good, simply list him as an accessory to tax fraud, as happened to New Brunswick, N.J., CPA Ed Mendlowitz. \"I dropped a client who was being audited and who produced a diary listing biweekly lunches with me to discuss her taxes and financial affairs,\" he says. \"I never had lunch with her.\" <123456789>"}

{"title": "30 Ways to Use Product Sourcing for eBay Selling", "text": "Not all aspiring eBay sellers want to become the next top power seller or run a multimillion dollar operation; some simply want to start a small business or earn a second income, but they may have difficulty product sourcing, or finding something to sell.If this sounds like you, here are 30 ideas for sourcing products in a way that's friendly to small and local businesses. Flea Markets and Swap Meets These little slices of Americana are full of independent local sellers often trading in collectible, antique or otherwise interesting goods at very low prices. You may have to spend time browsing, separate wheat from chaff, and also do a little cleaning/restoring in some cases, but many eBay sellers have made a good side income as weekend shoppers at flea markets and swap meets.Thrift Stores A similar thing can be said about thrift stores, with part-time sellers developing a thrift store \"circuit\" and range of goods in which they have expertise that they can check daily or at least several times a week.On the Street for FreeIn many of America's larger cities and metropolitan areas, a surprising amount of furniture and technology is simply discarded every week as trash. If you live in one of these major metropolitan areas, consider curb cruising by apartment buildings in upwardly mobile areas for furniture and technology goods.On the Street From VendorsStreet vendors in the largest metropolitan areas often act as or work for sources of cheap import goods that can be sold for a markup on eBay. Just be careful not to sell any kinds of goods that can get you into counterfeit or VeRO trouble.From Drop ShippersThere are a lot of these around the web and many sellers and retailers frown at their use. While it's true that as a business model drop shipping is more difficult to make work, it's also true that with a lot of diligence, some sellers have made a good living using drop shippers.From Competing Online RetailersDon't just think of Amazon.com, Buy.com, Newegg.com and other similar online retailers as \"the competition.\" Instead, keep an eye out for markdowns, deals, clearance items, and similar price breaks, as these are often opportunities to make good margins acting as a middleman. List on eBay and have them fulfill the order, just as you would with a drop shipper.From Small Local Independent BusinessesNearly every locale, no matter how small, has at least one and usually several \"hand-made, right here in town\" shops that deal in nonperishable goods. These days, they may already have their own website to sell their goods, but chances are that they don't work the eBay angle. Find them, talk to them and work the eBay angle for them.Around the HouseFor most Americans living a more-or-less consumerist lifestyle, there is ample opportunity to periodically go room-by-room through the house and identify things that can be sold off. For many American families or households, this can be done with surprising frequency.Your Existing Retail or Service BusinessIf you already own and operate a store or a service business, chances are there are goods, tools, stock of various kind, or other things that you'd like to either upgrade or liquidate. eBay is a great place to make this happen.Your Inner Creative SelfBooks and eBooks, knowledge and information of all kinds, paintings, crafts, or anything else that you do either for fun or for local profit can likely be sold on eBay if the quality is good and the price is right. Just be sure to identify your market and know what they desire.As a Neighborhood Consignment SellerStart a business as the eBay seller for your neighborhood. Get some cheap business cards, hang a shingle on the front of your house and tell your neighbors you'll help them clear out whatever is left after their garage sale (or even before it) on  consignment, for a cut of the eBay takings.By Having Hobbies and Frequenting-Related BusinessesIf you have a hobby, you have an area of expertise and know something about a market segment. You probably also frequent a set of businesses related to your hobby (whether it's comic books, golf, reading, or classic car repair) and know when you see a fabulous or rare deal at one of those businesses. Use that expertise and series of potential sources to help you decide what to acquire, stock and sell on eBay.Using eBay ItselfBuy lots of goods in various kinds on eBay and re-sell them piecemeal or buy entire \"for price\" items (cars, computers, appliances, etc.) and part them out on eBay. Or, find valuable goods on the eBay marketplace that would do better on another eBay property (Half.com, StubHub, etc.) and act as the middleman.Government Surplus or AuctionsMost government agencies, from state and local executive, legislative and judicial agencies to military bases and state-supported schools at all level (K-12 and universities) have surplus property divisions and auction agencies to help them liquidate old, upgraded, off-lease, law-enforcement or tax-confiscated, or other similar types of goods. Hit your local white pages and start calling state agencies of all kinds to inquire about their surplus sales and auction sales.Wherever You Need an UpgradeUpgrades have become a fact of life in our consumerist world, but far too many people simply toss out their old consumer electronics item, computer item, car part, household item, etc. rather than trying to re-sell or recycle it.Using Your Kids as Market ResearchIf you have teens or pre-teens, find out what they are dying to own or what is absolutely hot amongst their peers right now. Identify which of these items or trends is in short supply or find the local sources for these sorts of goods and re-sell them to kids in other markets.Product Releases, Supply ShortagesConsumer electronics devices are legendary for this, but other kinds of goods see it as well: uneven availability of a very hot product of some kind. Be willing to camp out to get the latest item from the major manufacturer and then sell as many as you can buy at a premium, or buy as many as you can in your local area to sell to buyers in areas (often across borders) where the items are in short supply.Dollar Stores, Odd-Lot StoresSurvey local dollar and odd-lot stores, particularly if you live in a major metropolitan area, for goods that sell for just a dollar in-store but that go for considerably more online. Candidates include electronics items and cables, tools and household goods, import novelties, and other durable goods.From LiquidatorsLiquidators can be great one-off sources of marketable stock, sometimes even highly desirable name-brand stock. Just be sure not to build a business model around one type of good or on the presumption that you'll continue to be able to get one particular kind of stock from liquidators in your area.Free and Open Online Content and InformationThere are a large number of informational \"products\" (ebooks, images, etc.) that are available under free/open source licenses online that grant anyone permission to re-sell them so long as certain basic requirements are met (often the preservation of a copyright notice). Project Gutenberg is one such example, but there are many others. Package these items up in various ways and resell them.Library SalesThough library sales often include a lot of low- or no-value media and books, they also often include a number of items that are actually worth more than the few cents or dollars that they sell for when resold on Half.com.Going-Out-of-Business SalesThough these are often simply marketing ploys, real, honest-to-god going-out-of-business sales can often be a great source of marketable stock allowing for decent margins.Estate Sales Look though the classifieds in your local newspaper for estate sales and other kinds of one-off sales of diverse kinds of goods; if you specialize in a kind of good often found at these types of sales (costume jewelry, for example, or vintage home decor), they can be a great source of sellable stock at very low prices, particularly if you negotiate multiple-item buys.Craigslist and the ClassifiedsMost obvious here are the large numbers of goods offered on such sites in some metropolitan areas for free on a first come, first serve basis.\" If you have access to transportation and can pursue free or very low-cost goods in an area of your expertise, you can resell those goods on eBay.Special Interest EventsThis category includes conferences, expos, and other shows of interest to industry insiders or special interest groups, but it also includes general interest events that are memorabilia-heavy like the Olympic Games or elections. Think of these as sources for goods that are automatically limited in supply. Choose them well and you can make decent margins on eBay.Factory Outlets and Scratch/Dent StoresThese kinds of stores often specialize in overstock, open-box, demo, and scratch/dent merchandise. Don't confuse with the variety of \"outlet malls\" that have become more popular across America that are simply regular strip malls by another name.As a Professional RecyclerBecome a \"recycler\" of goods of a particular kind that you know well and offer members of your community a small fee for their trouble or at least a cost-free way to dispose of goods like cars, computers, consumer electronics or clothing. Then, repair, part out, or simply select the best and sell the result.Using Pawn Shops or as a Pawn ShopPawn shops can be an amazing source of deals, often because they lack expertise in various kinds of goods that they end up selling. If you know a particular kind of stock inside and out, frequenting pawn shops looking for deals can be one way to earn extra on the side.As Professional Cleanup/De-JunkersForeclosing banks, relatives of deceased individuals, and even homeowners these days often make use of services paid simply to cart away \"junk\" of various (or of general) kinds. In many cases, a good portion of this junk has value, whether as raw materials or as eBay fodder.State or County FairsAnnual or semiannual fairs in many local areas are a great way to get in touch with local producers and manufacturers just dying to find a larger buying public. As an eBay seller, convince them to let it be your job to get them one."}
{"title": "Should You Borrow Money From a Life Insurance Policy?", "text": "Although traditional life insurance was developed to provide a death benefit to a beneficiary in the event of the insured person's death, several products evolved in the latter part of the 20th century that incorporated savings or investment. Borrowing from a life insurance policy can be considered if you have a permanent life insurance policy with values. Two examples of life insurance policies that provide cash values are whole life insurance and universal life insurance. Check your life insurance policy to see if it includes a loan provision.Can You Borrow Money From Term Life Insurance Policies?Cheap life insurance like term life insurance does not allow you to borrow money from the policy. The reason term life insurance is considered affordable or cheap, is because it is a pure life insurance policy, it has no value other than the actual death benefit to be payable upon the death of the insured, if the insured dies during the fixed term. The Basics of Borrowing From Your Life Insurance Policy If you are thinking about borrowing from your life insurance policy, you probably were sold a policy that offered cash values and used this as part of your strategy in deciding what kind of life insurance is best for you. The first thing you need to do if you are considering borrowing money or withdrawing funds from your life insurance is deciding if it makes sense in your circumstance. Before you borrow, ask your agent or representative to run an \"in-force illustration.\" An in-force illustration will show you how your loan will impact your policy. Also, explore other options and weigh the pros and cons of borrowing from your policy.How Does Borrowing From a Life Insurance Policy Work?When you borrow based on the cash value of your life insurance policy, you are borrowing money from the life insurance company. A loan from your insurance company is a lot easier to get than a bank loan because they are using the cash value of your policy as collateral. If you do not pay back the loan, they will take it from the cash value of your policy or your death benefit. One of the main problems with this is that if the loan is not paid back, and you don't pay the interest, then the interest will compound and be added to your loan balance, and may end up exceeding the cash value. Borrowing from your life insurance policy requires cautious planning and monitoring of your loan balance and cash values or you might risk losing your policy. This is where an in-force illustration will come in handy. When Can You Borrow From Your Life Insurance Policy?You can typically borrow or take cash from your life insurance policy after you have built the cash value. You will have to contact your financial planner or advisor, or your life insurance representative to find out what your cash value is and to discuss what the impact will be on your policy as well as if there will be tax implications.There are several factors that you need to consider before you cancel or cash out a life insurance policy, borrow against it or take cash values.Do You Have to Pay Back the Loan When Borrowing From Your Life Insurance Policy?Unlike bank loans or mortgages, you do not have to pay back the loan you take when borrowing from a permanent life insurance policy. However, when you borrow the money based on your cash value, the amount you borrow may reduce the death benefit from the life insurance portion of your policy. If you do not pay the loan back and the interest combined with the amount borrowed starts to exceed the cash value, you could put your life insurance policy at risk. This can happen more quickly than you think.5 Things to Check Before Borrowing From a Life Insurance PolicyBefore you borrow from a life insurance policy, you need to have a serious discussion with your financial planner or insurance advisor to understand the long term and short term consequences and risks.There are many hidden costs that you may not initially realize, and you want to make sure this is the best option for you. Discuss how the loan and interest will impact your life insurance policy to make sure that the death benefit portion of your policy is not threatened.Find out if you will have to pay an \"opportunity cost\"Make sure you can afford to pay the interest and other fees or figure out the strategy based on your specific policy that will make sense for you. Not all policies are the same and everyone's circumstance is different.If you can not pay back the interest on your loan, think twice. The in-force illustration will help you understand this aspect.If you are relying on the dividends of your policy to pay the interest on the loan, have a real look at the details with your representative or financial advisor. This can be costly if not structured properly.All of these issues should come up when you look at the in-force illustration of the impact of your loan with your agent or advisor. Reasons to Borrow From a Life Insurance Policy vs. the BankSome people bought life insurance with values specifically to build assets so that later on in life they can borrow from their life insurance policy or use the investments when they need to.Some people borrow from their life insurance policy to avoid the hassle of a loan from the bank. If you have the intention of repaying the loan in a reasonable amount of time, and keeping up with the interest payments so they do not accumulate, then this could be a hassle free option.Borrowing from your life insurance policy allows a lot more flexibility in repayment. For example, when you borrow from a bank, you have monthly payments to make over a fixed term, whereas if you borrow from your life insurance policy, you can pay back as little or as much as you want at any time interval. Again, you have to be careful how this impacts the value of your loan, vs. your cash value as interest accumulates, but if you only need a loan for a brief time, this can really help you borrow money and pay it back on your terms.If the amount you are borrowing is significantly less than your cash value and you have plans and the means to pay back the interest and value in a reasonable amount of time (your life insurance agent can help you figure this out), then borrowing from your policy will be a good option for you.You can borrow from a cash value permanent policy, but before you do make sure you are prepared to manage the transaction properly by having a thorough discussion with your planner.Beware of the Real Implication of Borrowing From Your Life Insurance PolicyWe've given you a basic list of things to look out for if you're considering borrowing from your policy, this information can be used as a starting point to discuss the option with your licensed advisor or representative and make an informed decision. There are smart ways to manage borrowing from your life insurance policy that can provide good benefits, but there are also risks when it is not done with careful planning.An example of how borrowing from your life insurance policy could be a problem, especially if you are borrowing money because you are having hard financial times, is that your cash value in your life policy is protected from creditors, but a loan from your life insurance policy is considered cash, and so this is no longer protected from creditors.The last thing you need is to take out a loan without having the big picture. What is most important for you to keep in mind is that this is not the same as pulling money out of a savings account, it's a complex transaction and you need to make sure you really understand it.Examples of Borrowing Money From a Life Insurance PolicyJane had been paying into her whole life insurance policy since she was 22. On her 40th birthday, she decided that she wanted to buy herself the sailboat she had always dreamed about as a gift to herself and spend some time on the water with the kids that summer before they became teenagers and got too busy to take the time to spend with family.She was still paying off her home, so she didn't want to take out an additional loan, so she decided to use some of her savings, and borrow the remaining $20,000 she needed from the cash value of her life insurance policy.When she called to get the loan and discussed the consequences with her financial advisor, she found out that she could borrow the money, but that the amount might reduce the amount of her death benefit. This would mean that if something happened to her and she died, her family would only get the death benefit, less the amount of the loan if she didn't pay it back. That didn't bother her so much, but then her financial advisor went on to explain that even though she didn't have to pay back the loan, she could end up paying interest, and compound interest. When they worked out the details, Jane decided the loan for the sailboat probably wasn't the best use of her accumulated cash value, and she decided to rent a boat instead, and not risk paying all the fees and compound interest or risk her policy long term.Example of Borrowing From a Life Insurance Policy to Start a BusinessJane decides she wants to take money from her life insurance policy to start her own business. She has never run a business before, so she is worried about borrowing from the bank. She also doesn't want to have another loan on her credit report. Because Jane has already done some market research and has had some demand for her services already, she thinks she can manage to pay back her life insurance loan within two years. Borrowing the money as an investment into herself and the future business makes sense, so she takes out the loan."}
{"title": "Roth Conversion Implications for New York State Residents", "text": "A Roth individual retirement account (IRA) allows you to accumulate investment returns on a tax-free basis. You can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and later take tax-free distributions without worrying about IRS rules. However, there is one caveat -- you have to pay federal and state taxes when you convert.New York's tax laws conform to the federal laws pertaining to Roth IRA conversion. As such, residents and non-residents who convert to the Roth must report the conversion amount as part of adjusted gross income (AGI), which will be taxed at the account owner's income tax rate. You can spread out the conversion taxes over a two-year spread period. You can recognize the entire conversion immediately.If you're at least age 59 1/2, New York allows you to exclude up to $20,000 in total pension or annuity conversion income. Because your total conversion is added to your income -- even if you didn't take a distribution -- this means that you'll save income taxes on $20,000 of your conversion. For example, if you spread your conversion over two years, you can exclude $10,000 of conversion income in each year. You can also use the $20,000 exclusion if you're age 59 1/2 and plan to take a distribution instead.There are other Roth IRA conversion rules you must follow as well. For example, you can only contribute $5,000 annually, or $6,000 if you're older than age 50. If you're married, file your income taxes jointly and want to contribute to a Roth, your AGI cannot exceed $177,000 for you to be eligible for a Roth. That means you may be able to convert existing balances to a Roth, but you cannot make additional contributions to the account.You can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in one of three ways. The most common way is called the \"rollover.\" You'll receive a distribution from the traditional account and deposit the funds into a new Roth IRA within 60 days. Be forewarned: if you don't complete the transfer within 60 days, you'll have to pay a 10 percent penalty. You can also perform a trustee to trustee transfer or a same trustee transfer if your IRA funds a trust. Regardless of how the funds are rolled over, you'll have to pay conversion taxes to both New York State and the federal government."}

{"title": "Highest-Paying LPN Jobs", "text": "Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) are nurses who work under the direction of both physicians and registered nurses (RNs) at hospitals and other medical clinics. While the wages for an LPN are not always high, LPNs can find the highest-paying jobs based on the type of facility in which they wish to work, by their location and by pursuing higher education.\n\nLPNs can seek higher salaries in different industries or locations.\n\nMedical Facilities\n\nMost LPNs work in medical facilities such as hospitals and clinics. Both general medical and surgical hospitals offer wages lower than the overall national average salary for LPNs, which is $40,900 as of May 2009. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that nursing care facilities, home health care services and community care facilities for the elderly all offer higher average salaries at $42,320, $42,300 and $41,950 respectively. Dental offices also pay higher salaries for LPNs at an average of $43,220 annually.\n\nOther Industries\n\nLPNs can seek higher-paying jobs in other industries outside of medical facilities. The Bureau states that in office administrative services the average salary for an LPN is $42,730, while those working in rooming and boarding houses earn $45,530. LPNs working in activities related to real estate earn an average salary of $45,600 a year, and those in employment services earn the highest salary average of $46,190 a year.\n\nLocation\n\nCertain areas in the United States offer higher wages for LPNs due to demand and/or cost of living. The Bureau names Salinas, San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco, California as the nation's top four highest paying metropolitan areas for LPNs with salary averages ranging from $56,920 to $59,670, followed by Albuquerque, New Mexico at $56,080. Connecticut is the country's highest paying state for LPNs with an average salary of $52,300, followed by New Jersey at $50,350 and Rhode Island at $50,010.\n\nAdvancement\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics states that LPNs working in nursing homes often have the opportunity to advance into higher-paying roles, such as charge nurses, who oversee the work of other LPNs. An LPN may also increase her wages by seeking credentials and certification in a speciality field such as IV therapy, gerontology or pharmacology."}
{"title": "How to Get Life Insurance With No Medical Exam and No Health Questions", "text": "Guaranteed issue whole life insurance meets the needs of people with health conditions that would preclude the issuance of a more traditional term or whole life policy. Their main attraction is that they are offered on a no-questions-asked basis \u2013 that is, you're covered for life, or until you stop paying premiums. Thus, even if you have a serious disease like AIDS or cancer, you still can purchase life insurance coverage.\n\nGuaranteed issue policies can provide the cash to cover final expenses\n\ncredit: jrwasserman/iStock/Getty Images\n\nGuaranteed Issue Whole Life Insurance\n\nGuaranteed issue whole life insurance policies are graded benefit, high cost, low face-value whole life policies.They are offered by such companies as Colonial Penn, AAA Life Insurance Company and Globe, as well as Mutual of Omaha. Applicants generally must be in the range of about 45 to 85, depending on the carrier. Premiums remain level for the life of the policy; as long as those premiums are paid on time, the policy remains in force and cannot be cancelled for any reason. In addition, like other whole life policies, they accrue cash value. However, they're offered with limitations and restrictions.\n\nGraded Benefit\n\nThe first limitation of guaranteed issue life insurance is that the insurance isn't in full force until after two full years of coverage. If you die during the first two years, the death benefit paid to your beneficiaries generally will be the amount you paid in premiums plus interest, although some companies will pay the full face amount for accidental death. After the policy's been in force for two years, though, the full face amount is paid at the policyholder's death regardless of cause\n\nHigh Cost\n\nAnother disadvantage of guaranteed issue policies is their cost. These policies are generally purchased by people considered a poor risk for insurers, those who cannot qualify for a more traditional policy. Thus, the cost per unit of coverage -- usually $1,000 but sometimes another amount -- is significantly higher than other whole life or term products on the market.\n\nLow Face Amount\n\nGuaranteed issue policies are available only in relatively small face amounts that rarely exceed $25,000. They generally are intended to pay final expenses and perhaps provide a financial cushion as the family adjusts to the loss of income, but won't be sufficient to meet such expenses as funding higher education or paying off a mortgage.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nWhile guaranteed issue life insurance is ideal for people whose health disqualifies them from coverage under a more traditional policy, don't assume this is the case in your situation. Before purchasing a guaranteed-issue policy, get a couple of quotes from traditional carriers. It costs nothing, and if you're turned down it won't affect your eligibility for a guaranteed policy."}

Here are some tips for making your dealings go smoothly.\nOnline banking\nOnline banking can simplify and speed up your checking account management. For example, you no longer have to call the bank or wait for a monthly statement to see if a check cleared. Instead you can log on to your account and in seconds can see if the transaction has taken place.\nThe benefits of online banking don't stop there. Among other things, you can pay bills, transfer money between accounts and set up e-mail alerts from your bank tipping you off to things such as when a check clears or when the balance drops below a certain level.\nBankrate.com can help you find online checking accounts with the best rates.\nProtect yourself\nThere's no reason to be shy about doing online banking, but you must exercise caution in regard to user names and passwords so no one gains unauthorized access to your account. Be careful about e-mails you receive that purport to be from your financial institution. Make it a practice to not click on any links in e-mails that request personal information; call the bank and see if the e-mail is legitimate. The best way to access your financial institution's Web site is by typing the online address yourself; not clicking on a link. Just as you need to take steps to protect your accounts, banks also need to address the issue of account hijacking.\nWhether you bank online or use more traditional methods, you need to review your monthly statements and reconcile your records with the bank's. It's always important to quickly catch any discrepancies so that they can be corrected, and to ensure that there have been no unauthorized transactions.\nFinancial institutions that you do business with have a lot of personal information about you. They make money by selling that information to other companies. If you don't want them to do that you need to let them know. Financial institutions are required to let you \"opt out\" of having that information shared with certain companies. It's not the greatest consumer law on the books, but it gives you some rights. Information banks give you about opting out may be sent with your periodic statement or by itself.\nThe Patriot Act\nThe war on terrorism is having an impact on banks. Financial institutions now are being held to higher standards with regard to verifying the identity of people who open accounts. You can expect to have to show proof of who you are and, possibly, answer some questions about the source of the money you'll use to fund the account. For more information, read about the Patriot Act and what it means for your bank accounts.\nWhat assets are protected?\nIn today's banking world where the lines have blurred between banks, brokerages and insurance companies, it's important to know which accounts are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and which accounts aren't covered. While deposits are insured up to $100,000 per customer and $250,000 for retirement accounts, there are ways to set up accounts to insure much more money.\nYou'll probably never have to rely on FDIC coverage if your bank practices good financial management. You can get a good idea of an institution's financial health by checking Bankrate.com's Safe & Sound rating system. The best time to check is before opening an account, but it's smart to monitor your bank anytime."}

{"title": "10 Questions Employers Should Never Ask During an Interview", "text": "Conducting job interviews is a hard task. Most people don't conduct interviews all that often and so they don't get a lot of practice. Of course, if you're a recruiter, you should have refined skills, but for the hiring managers, most don't hire more than once or twice a year. So their skills are rusty\u2014at best.While many articles focus on the interview questions you should ask, there are also questions that you should never ask. You don't ask some questions because of legal reasons and others because they aren't helpful in selecting an employee.Here are 10 questions that you should never ask. Some of them might surprise you.1. Oh! I Went to South High School, Too. What Year Did You Graduate?High school graduation is a sticky question because it indicates your candidate's age\u2014give or take a year. Age discrimination for people over 40 is illegal, and the only age that you need to know is if they are over 18 or 21, depending on the job.Most interviewers would never ask a candidate how old he or she is, but questions like this slip out, especially when the topic comes up in a normal conversation. When you find out that your candidate has something in common with you, it's natural to try to build connections.Hold off on this connection, though, until after you have made a job offer. If you hire the person, you will have plenty of time to laugh about running laps in Mrs. Jones' PE class.2. I Love Your Accent. Where Are You From?First of all, have you looked at the person's resume? That will give you an idea of where your candidate has lived, but otherwise, national origin is a protected class. Lots of people love cool accents. You mean nothing discriminatory by the question. But, if you don't hire the person, they could look back on that question as national origin discrimination.Likewise, the same goes for an individual who looks like they aren't from the United State. If their resume says their address is Pittsburgh, then as far as you're concerned, they come from Pittsburgh.3. How Many Kids Do You Have?This question often comes up in the small talk portion of the job interview or if you take your candidate out to lunch. The children subject is often brought up by the interviewee. She'll see a picture of your kids on your desk and comment and the polite thing to do is to ask her the same question back.Except, in a job interview, you want to let that question go. The proper questions relate to the ability of your candidate to do the job. You can say, \u201cThis job doesn't have good flexibility. We're pretty rigid about our hours. Will that work for you?\u201d You especially don't want to get into plans for future children, as pregnancy discrimination violates the law.4. Are You a US Citizen?The question you can ask regarding this issue is, \u201cAre you authorized to work in the United States?\u201d And, really, the hiring manager shouldn't need to ask this question at all. Your job application should ask this question and the recruiter was responsible for weeding out candidates who can't legally work here.5. What Language Do You Speak at Home?This question also puts you into national origin discrimination territory. If you're hiring an employee for a position that requires multi-lingual capabilities, the question to ask is, \u201cWhat languages do you speak?\u201d And, for further clarification, \u201cHow well do you speak that language?\u201d Ideally, you should have a current employee who speaks the language you are looking for to interview the candidate and assess their language skills.6. Do You Have Any Disabilities?Some disabilities are obvious. If the person is in a wheelchair, you'll know it. But, many disabilities that are protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act aren't obvious during a job interview. Don't ask. Again, even though you would never intentionally discriminate against someone with a disability, once you know, you have set yourself up for the accusation that you did.You can ask the candidate if they are capable of doing the job. If a candidate does have a disability that needs an accommodation, the candidate should bring it up to you after you've made a job offer.7. What Would You Do if a Penguin With a Sombrero Walked in the Front Door?Some hiring managers like to ask these fun and creative questions they found on the internet. Please don't. Unless you're in the business of zoo animal fiestas, there is no answer to this question that will help you evaluate the candidate.Keep your questions relevant to the job. Don't try to pry into personality. Unless you're a trained psychologist, you won't even know how to interpret the candidate's answers. Ask about knowledge, skills and abilities instead.8. Do You Need Health Insurance?Yes, everyone needs health insurance. If you're asking because the job doesn't offer health insurance, and you want to make them aware, just say it flat out during the phone screen. \u201cThis job doesn't offer health insurance. Are you still interested in interviewing?\u201dBy waiting until the interview and asking your candidate if he needs health insurance, what you're really doing is prying into their marital status, the employment status of their spouse, their health status, and their financial independence. Don't ask.9. What Did You Hate About Your Last Job?This can seem like a good question, as you can use it as a set up a situation in which you are extolling the virtues of the position you're offering. But, the question opens up the opportunity for your candidate to become very negative.Candidates dislike something about their current job, or they wouldn't be job searching. But, they are generally trying hard to stay positive. Instead, ask questions about what they are looking for in their new job. \u201cWhat are you looking for in your new job?\u201d is a better, more positive question.10. What Church Do You Attend?Unless you're hiring for a faith-based organization, this question is a no-go. Again, it often comes up in small talk and seems harmless, but you cannot discriminate on the basis of religion unless it's pertinent to the job. (So, yes, you can require that the minister for your Lutheran church is Lutheran, but you can't require that your grocery store cashier has the same beliefs as you.)The only time religion is relevant in a secular interview is if the person needs an accommodation, in which case it is their responsibility to bring it up after you've made an offer. Then, you can decide together if an accommodation is possible.When you're conducting job interviews, keep your focus on the actual job and the skills you need the new employee to possess and you won't go wrong or off-track with your interview questions. These are ten examples of questions you don't want to ask and why you don't want to ask them."}

Pledging to \u201coffer the most for the least,\u201d the firm simultaneously provides customers relatively low fees and a wide selection of financial products. At $6.95 per trade, their flat commission rate is competitive, though a bit higher than some discount brokers. For this, investors can trade in stocks, bonds and options, as well as ETFs \u2013 ten of which are commission-free \u2013 and over 11,000 mutual funds. This selection beats many of Firstrade\u2019s lower-priced competitors, although not the slightly-more-expensive E*Trade, which boasts almost ten times the number of commission-free ETFs.\nFirstrade\u2019s website receives high marks from customers and is frequently described as clean and user-friendly. Each client\u2019s dashboard is customizable and features streaming quotes. Should the website prove less intuitive for some, however, the brokerage\u2019s customer service receives mixed reviews from members. Many complain of receiving misinformation from representatives or long waits to receive withdrawn funds. The firm does outpace its competition, though, by offering phone assistance in Mandarin and Cantonese, in addition to English. While many of its competitors won\u2019t shell out for the licensing to make themselves available to investors outside of the United States, let alone offer them easy-to-understand customer service, Firstrade caters to its international clients.\nFirstrade recently launched a revamped research section on its website, including reports from Morningstar \u2013 the site previously lacked third-party research \u2013 and an enhanced news section. The site also expanded the data available in its stock screener, among other tools. For $19.95 per month, users can access Level II quotes and advanced charting options through the site\u2019s X-Stream Level II service. However, former subscribers suggest that the content is still less impressive than what some competitors offer.\nInternational customers should make Firstrade among their top choices for a brokerage. Some domestic investors may prefer a firm with lower commissions or better research tools, but others will find Firstrade\u2019s selection of products and trading platform just right for the price point."}

Their gifts are investments in the work they expect you to accomplish. They want results.So results are the best way to show your appreciation for your donors. Most donors don't need plaques or trinkets.  For most donors, too much bling may cause them to question your spending priorities.Donors want to see what their gifts helped you to accomplish. They love particular facts and stories of how they changed the lives of real people. That's how they know their investment paid off.Donors want to hear about the women they helped shelter from domestic violence, the lonely senior citizens whose lives are brightened by your daily visits, or the inner-city children who were inspired by their first encounter with organic gardening at your community farm.Tell your supporters, in person if you can, or through newsletters, email, and phone calls, how someone's life was changed by the programs they made possible.In addition to stories, do not underestimate the power of facts and statistics. Share as much detail as you can about the progress you have made, the number of people you have reached, and the effectiveness of your work. Learn about SROI (social return on investment) and how to use it to illustrate the good that you do. For instance, show the impact your orchestra program has on the math scores of the children you serve, the track record of your life skills program, the number of affordable houses you have built for struggling families,or the percentage of the troubled teens who go on to graduate from college after participating in your mentoring program.Instead of fancy baubles or plaques, find inexpensive and personal ways to thank your donors and connect them to your mission.Think about gestures that mean so much more than the traditional ways of saying thanks. Have the students from one of your classrooms hand deliver a scroll of paper with their handprints and thank you messages; stop by with a rescued dog and pictures of the abused animals the donor helped rescue; or send a simple personal note from a staff member or volunteer with a signed photo of the grateful recipients of your organization's services.Whether you have a complex research program, a public policy group, or a local health services clinic, there is a compelling way to honor your donors with the facts about what their money allowed you to do and the firsthand stories about the lives it changed.By recognizing and reporting results back to your donors frequently and well, you make lasting friends. This deeper recognition of the difference they make is the thanks they want, and it will cause them to remain loyal to your organization for a lifetime and to keep asking, \"How else can I help you?\""}
{"title": "Reduce Your Tax Liability With 10 Tax-Free Benefits", "text": "With tax season right around the corner, all employees are thinking about how much Uncle Sam is deducting from every paycheck. For most, it\u2019s between 20 to as much as 50 percent of gross earnings. While smart employees take advantage of pre-tax savings plans, retirement savings, and other ways to stretch their dollars \u2014 there is a host of other tax-free benefits that they may not be aware of (or their employer doesn\u2019t currently offer them).Every company is looking for ways to boost their employee benefits package without going overboard on costs. Many are hoping to find ways to save money too. In order to provide the maximum value in a total compensation strategy, here is a list of the top 10 tax-free benefits you want to add to your package.1. Company VehiclesIf your company offers a fleet for use by employees, you can deduct the mileage on annual tax reports. Employees pay nothing for this benefit and it\u2019s completely tax-free for them. The only real issue comes when considering the high tax paid for gasoline to power the vehicle, which can be offset by using a fuel discount program.2. Company Provided EquipmentAnother benefit that\u2019s tax-free for employees is company provided equipment, such as electronics, mobile devices, and other technology perks. Many employees enjoy being able to use the latest in software and hardware, particularly those who work offsite. Not only is this a tax-free benefit, but it can be claimed on corporate taxes as depreciated value over 1-4 years from date of purchase.3. Frequent Flyer Miles and Travel PointsFor employees who must travel for business purposes, there are a number of tax-free benefits that they can enjoy. Frequent flyer mile programs can be participated in, giving the company and employees free airline miles for future trips and discounts. Hotel chains offer rewards programs that let employees rack up points for gift cards and free hotel stays.4. Communication BillsIf employees are required to furnish their own cell phone, internet service or other communication solution as part of their job, the company can reimburse them on a monthly basis completely tax-free. However, these items must be used exclusively for the business and not for personal use, otherwise the employee cannot claim them on their home office use tax return.5. Meals and LodgingUnder IRS rules, when employers provide lodging and meals as part of the terms of employment or for employee events, this is a tax-free employee benefit. Many employers are offering free meals as part of their wellness program, and this is also tax-free.6. Commuter and Parking CostsMany employees must commute to work each day from long distances, therefore the IRS allows a pre-tax deduction of up to $125 a month for public transportation, twice that for parking, and a combined tax-free benefit for both needs. Companies that provide free parking and transportation for employees do not have to pay tax for this benefit.7. Dependent Care SupportWhen employees are forced to care for dependents or aging family members, a portion of their dependent care benefits is tax-free each year. This is generally around $5,000 per year of a dependent care assistance plan.8. Corporate Wellness ProgramsThe leading companies understand the importance of maintaining a healthy workforce, therefore corporate wellness programs are a popular choice. This is not only a tax-free benefit, but it can reduce health insurance premiums over time.9. Non-cash Rewards and SwaggerCompanies that want to maximize their incentive programs, but remain tax-free, can give out non-cash gift cards and corporate branded prizes to employees. Examples are gift certificates for local restaurants and sporting events, t-shirts, hats, and coozies. Employees love them and they don\u2019t cost the company much to attain.10. Corporate Learning and DevelopmentA well-educated and trained workforce is a strong and productive one. Therefore, one of the best tax-free benefits a company can offer is a learning and development program for employees to enhance their skills. Tuition reimbursement is also tax-free up to a certain amount each year."}
{"title": "Ask Brianna: Do I Really Need a Budget in My 20s?", "text": "\u201cAsk Brianna\u201d is a Q&A column for 20-somethings, or anyone else starting out. I\u2019m here to help you manage your money, find a job and pay off student loans \u2014 all the real-world stuff no one taught us how to do in college. Send your questions about postgrad life to askbrianna@nerdwallet.com.\nThis week\u2019s question:\nI\u2019ve heard I\u2019m supposed to create and stick to a budget, but that seems complicated and time-consuming. Do I really need a budget in my 20s?\nIt is, unequivocally, a good idea to have a plan for how you spend your money. With a budget, you won\u2019t spend your whole paycheck \u2014 after you\u2019ve paid rent and bills \u2014 on dinners out and Amazon impulse buys. You\u2019ll be more likely to set money aside for future needs, like retirement and emergencies.\nSome swear by a certain budgeting app or a painstakingly color-coded Google Sheet. But budgeting doesn\u2019t have to mean tracking every expense and cutting out the little things that make you happy. Even financial advisors understand that can be restrictive and hard to maintain.\n\u201cI always equate the word \u2018budget\u2019 to \u2018diet,\u2019\u201d says Mindy Crary, a financial coach at Creative Money in Seattle.\nInstead, think about budgeting as a way to set goals for the things you want to do in the future, a way to put your money to work. One approach: Get a handle on the expenses you can\u2019t avoid; come up with a dollar amount you want to save every month; then spend the rest as you please. Here\u2019s what that looks like in three easy steps.\nStep 1: Lower your fixed costs\n\u201cWhen thinking about budgets, people usually default to thinking about how to cut their everyday consumption,\u201d says Hui-chin Chen, a financial planner and co-owner of Pavlov Financial Planning in Arlington, Virginia.\nBut buying a cup of coffee every day will not bankrupt you. Living in an apartment, driving a car or making a student loan payment you can\u2019t afford is more problematic.\nSome expenses are easier to trim than others. Federal student loans come with income-driven repayment plans that will let you pay a certain percentage of your income each month to keep your bill affordable. Stick with roommates, and hold off on moving into a luxury apartment building if that would increase your housing costs to 30% or more of your income.\nStep 2: Focus on saving\nYou don\u2019t have to account for every penny you shell out. Another way to make sure you don\u2019t overspend is to come up with a savings goal first, then back your way into a budget that allows you to hit that goal, Crary says.\nSome of your savings should go to an emergency fund until you\u2019ve got at least $500 put away for unexpected expenses, such as medical costs or car repairs. Some must go toward retirement; contribute at least enough to meet the employer match on your 401(k), if one is offered, or start to beef up your IRA. The rest can go to a savings account that you\u2019ll use to hit other goals like travel or a down payment on a house. The amount you have left over is often called \u201cdisposable income,\u201d or what you can spend on nonessential expenses, like shopping and entertainment.\n\u201cAs a starting point, if you have never really thought about it, setting up an automatic deduction from checking into savings is a good way to test out your budget and lifestyle,\u201d Chen says.\nStep 3: Re-evaluate\nIf you can\u2019t save any money, it may be that you simply can\u2019t live on the amount you earn. Consider adding to your income by hitting the LinkedIn circuit in search of a higher-paying job, or look into temporary side gigs in the meantime.\nYou can also take a look at last month\u2019s bank or credit card statements and consider making changes if there\u2019s a particular area of spending that is really out of whack. The changes can be behavioral rather than based on dollar amounts, Crary says: If you went out to eat 15 times, try to go out seven times next month instead.\nNo month of spending will be exactly the same. You can\u2019t always plan ahead for a friend\u2019s birthday brunch or a stolen bicycle tire. Focus on maintaining balance instead. Aim to take the stress out of budgeting, and you might find you like knowing where your money goes after all."}
{"title": "What Is Unearned Revenue & Where Is It Reported in Financial Statements?", "text": "Unearned revenue is money that comes into a company before it provides a service or product to a buyer. It is a liability until the company \"earns\" it by delivering its obligations. Companies are required to provide four financial statements every quarter: the income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement and statement of shareholder's equity. Unearned revenue moves through reporting statements as it turns from unearned to earned revenue.\n\nClose-up of financial reports and calculator\n\ncredit: alzay/iStock/Getty Images\n\nUnearned Revenue Overview\n\nUnearned revenue reports the amount of money a company has collected, without yet providing the goods and/or services to satisfy the obligation. Companies that typically have big unearned revenues accounts include real estate and insurance companies. For real estate companies, rent is commonly paid before the service has been provided; therefore, when a company receives rent payments, it records the rent amount as unearned revenues. Insurance companies encounter a similar situation, because they receive insurance premiums before they provide insurance protection.\n\nUnearned Revenue Reporting\n\nThe unearned revenue amount at the end of the time period is reported on the balance sheet. The cash flows from unearned revenue are recorded on the cash flow statement. Unearned revenue flows through the income statement, as it is earned by the company. One factor to keep in mind is to make sure the prepaid revenues are collected with cash, not with an accounts receivable. Cash is preferred, as it provides more certainty that the sales are not fraudulent and the buyer is committed for the purchase of the goods.\n\nUnearned Revenue Example\n\nA real estate company owns one property and has one tenant. The tenant pays rent of $1,000 one month ahead of the service provided. At the beginning of each month, when the real estate company receives the payment, the company would record an increase of $1,000 to unearned revenue and an increase of $1,000 to cash. The unearned revenue of $1,000 would then turn into revenue of $1,000 at the end of the month.\n\nUnearned Revenue Benefits\n\nIf the company has a high unearned revenue from its normal operations, then that represents a large cash flow benefit. That means the company does not need to have the capital ahead of time to allow for the provision of services and products. For investors, unearned revenue provides some idea of future reporting revenues and earnings. If unearned revenue is on the books, investors already have some idea of what future revenue will be. That will give them an advantage in trying to forecast future results."}
{"title": "Secured Credit Card - 10 Questions About Getting One", "text": "credit cards\n10 questions to ask before getting a secured credit card\nIt's tough to get by without a credit card. You need one to make a hotel or plane reservation, or to rent a car, even if you plan to pay cash. Responsible use of a credit card builds a good credit rating, too, marking the owner as mortgage-worthy. But people who have never had credit or need to repair a poor credit history may not qualify for a regular credit card. For them, a secured credit card may be the only way to establish, or re-establish, credit. CARD SEARCH: Check out the latest secured credit card offers from our partners. 10 questions to ask about secured credit cards: What is a secured credit card? Where can I get a secured credit card? What kind of charges will there be? How much money do I have to deposit? Do all banks offer secured credit cards? Are there any problems to watch out for? Does the issuer report to all three major credit bureaus? How long does it take to qualify for an unsecured card? Will my deposit earn interest? How can I make the best use of a secured card to build my credit rating? If you need to build credit, here are the answers to the top 10 questions about secured credit cards. 1. What is a secured credit card? A secured card requires a cash collateral deposit that becomes the credit line for that account. For example, if you put $500 in the account, you can charge up to $500. You may be able to add to the deposit to extend your credit, or sometimes a bank will reward you for good payment and add to your credit line without requesting additional deposits. 2. Where can I get a secured credit card? Check Bankrate.com's list of secured credit card issuers. If you're a credit union member, ask about a secured card there. Many credit unions offer secured cards to their members and may offer lower interest rates and waive annual fees. 3. What kind of charges will there be? This is where it pays to shop around. Avoid any card that wants you to pay an application fee. Most secured cards do charge an annual fee, and they vary dramatically. Read the fine print. Some people have gotten secured cards and have seen their entire deposit (and credit limit) eaten up by fees before they ever used the card. 4. How much money do I have to deposit? Again, the amount will vary by the card. Most allow minimum deposits of $300 or $500. Your credit limit will either be the amount of your deposit or some percentage above that amount. 5. Do all banks offer secured credit cards? No. Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at Consumer Action, says her organization is seeing a trend in banking away from secured cards and toward unsecured cards with lower limits and higher interest rates and fees. Still, secured cards are a good choice -- and sometimes the only option -- for people who are just starting out or rebuilding after a major life event, such as a divorce, job loss or serious illness. In addition, some issuers give secured cards only to people who are new to credit -- not those who have already had one crack and blew it. 6. Are there any problems to watch out for? Yes. Howard Dvorkin, chairman of Debt.com, calls secured credit cards \"a Clint Eastwood movie -- the good, the bad and the ugly. Some are good. They have low fees and treat customers as customers instead of as cattle. The bad ones take advantage and extort the clients because of their situations. Then there's the ugly, which are completely despicable. They'll give you the card, but you have to buy this insurance policy for $55 a month.\" The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken several enforcement actions against credit card issuers for deceptively marketing add-on products over the past few years, though secured cards, specifically, have yet to be a focal point. You should gather plenty of information when you apply for a card. In addition, pay attention to such important items as interest rates, fees and the required deposit. <span />\n7. Does the issuer report to all 3 major credit bureaus? The reason for having a secured card goes far beyond being able to buy things online. It's a vehicle for building a good credit history. If the issuer doesn't report, you've lost a major benefit. (Tip: If you start getting mailers offering you unsecured cards after you've made several months of payments on time, you'll know that the bank is reporting.) Ask if the issuer will flag the report to the credit bureaus as a secured card. Consumer Action points out that such a flag could be a deterrent to rebuilding credit. You can also learn for yourself whether your issuer is reporting by checking your credit reports. Do it for free at myBankrate. 8. How long does it take to qualify for an unsecured card? The card issuer should want to keep you as a customer, so most will qualify you for an unsecured card after a period in which you've made all of your payments on time. The average is about a year. 9. Will your deposit earn interest? Most issuers do not pay interest on a customer\u2019s security deposit, though a few do offer rewards on spending. Also, find out how long the money has to stay on deposit after the account is closed. Some banks will want to keep the deposit for a couple of billing cycles to cover any stray charges that arrive. 10. How can I make the best use of a secured card to build my credit rating? Buy a few things and pay off the card every month. \"People should not get these cards to carry any balance,\" Sherry says. While secured cards make sure you never spend more money than you can afford, it's not a good idea to keep one any longer than you have to, experts say. Secured cards have higher annual fees and interest rates than regular, unsecured cards. If you have enough discipline to use a secured card responsibly, you have enough to use an unsecured card and set up a better savings program on your own. \"We recommend to people that it should be a steppingstone,\" Sherry says."}

{"title": "How to Set Up Share Classes for a New Corporation in Canada", "text": "Question: How Do I Set Up Share Classes for My New Corporation?Answer:When you are creating a new corporation in Canada and preparing your Articles of Incorporation, one of the things you will have to do is set up share classes. A share in a company represents a fractional part of the ownership of the company.This article explains three share classes that may be used when setting up a new corporation in Canada (Common Voting Shares, Common Non-Voting Shares, and Preferred Shares) and explains when and why you might want to use each share class.Single Share Class (Common Voting Shares)Setting up share classes for a new corporation doesn't have to be complicated. As corporations are owned by their shareholders, you have to have one class of shares.Legally, that's all a small, non-reporting corporation has to have \u2013 one share class of Common Voting Shares. These are distributed among all the shareholders, who then have the right to vote at any shareholder meetings, receive dividends as declared from time to time and receive the remaining property of the corporation on dissolution (after all the corporation's creditors are paid). (See Closing a Business for the steps required to dissolve a corporation.)Note that a non-reporting corporation cannot be listed on a stock exchange. Reporting corporations can list their shares on an exchange; however, in order to do so they must adhere to a higher level of regulatory compliance and issue a prospectus to potential purchasers.It is entirely possible to have a single shareholder; in that case, the person setting up the new corporation sets up the single share class so that he or she has one hundred percent of the shares. (Remember when it comes to shares, it's the percentage of shares that determines ownership, not the number. One hundred percent of the shares may mean 1 share or 100,000 shares, depending on how many shares the corporate owners decide to issue when the corporation is set up.)When one member of a married couple sets up a corporation it is quite common for the shares to be split between partners so the other member can receive dividends from the company. See Salary or Dividends - How Do I Pay Myself?Multiple Share Classes (Non-Voting Common Shares)So if one share class is all you need to have when you set up a new corporation in Canada, why would you want to have any more?Well, maybe there are people you want to have as shareholders in your new corporation but you don\u2019t want them to have the right to vote. For instance, you might want to assign shares to your children. Or you may want to use shares as a way to get employees more vested in your company \u2013 without giving them the means to determine company policy.For these reasons and others, it's often advantageous to set up at least one other share class when you're setting up a new corporation, Non-Voting Common Shares. These shareholders would be entitled to receive dividends and have a place in line if your corporation ends up being dissolved, but would not be able to vote.Corporation Canada's Incorporation Kit provides this example of such an arrangement of share classes for the Articles of Incorporation:\"The corporation is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Class A and Class B shares. The Class A shareholders shall be entitled to vote at all shareholder meetings, except meetings at which only holders of a specified class of share entitle their holders to vote and to receive such dividend as the board of directors in their discretion shall declare. Subject to the provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Class B shares shall be non-voting. Upon liquidation or dissolution, the holders of Class A and Class B shares shall share equally the remaining property of the corporation.\"Preferred SharesYou may also wish to set up x number of share classes of Preferred Shares. Preferred shares are just that from a prospective investor\u2019s point of view; they offer shareholders advantages over shareholders that only hold Common Shares. Like Common Shares, they can be voting or non-voting, but other than that, the preferences are specified when the share class is created.For instance, when you are creating your new corporation, you might set up a Class C of shares which are Preferred Shares that are non-voting but give shareholders of that class the right to collect dividends at a set amount and to be first in line (after creditors) if the corporation is dissolved.Any number of Preferred Share Classes can be set up, each with distinct rights attached. This is why Preferred Shares are often used to try and entice people to invest and raise money for the corporation. In return for investing in a business, most Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists receive preferred shares which give them specific rights and privileges over those of the common shareholders.So when you are setting up share classes for your new corporation, you want to consider who you want to participate in the corporation and what that participation will entail.Issue Extra Shares for Future UseOne last point about setting up share classes. For future flexibility, it's a good idea not to issue all the shares in your corporation but to keep some in your Treasury. This makes it much easier to have new shareholders join the corporation later on and avoids getting into things such as fractional shares.For the same reason, originally issuing a larger number of shares than a smaller number often turns out to be more convenient. For instance, if there are two shareholders in your new corporation and you issue only two shares, one each, you have none to sell to anyone else.Back to > Incorporation in Canada FAQs Index"}
{"title": "HUD Loan Requirements", "text": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development offers loans with favorable payment terms for homeowners who may have trouble qualifying for a traditional mortgage. The Federal Housing Authority insures these loans to encourage lenders to take on the additional risk that these borrowers may represent. If the borrower defaults, the FHA will compensate the lender for its losses. Because of this financial risk to the FHA, you must meet certain requirements to qualify for a HUD loan.\n\nCredit Requirements\n\nYour credit report generally must show a score of at least 580, and no more than two 30-day late payments in the previous two years, to secure a HUD loan. In some cases, however, you can qualify if you have never established a credit score.\n\n\n\nYou may be able to justify some minor credit issues if you have recently gone through a major life change, such as losing your job, moving to a new location or suffering a serious injury This shows that you have a valid reason for missing payments and post a less serious risk of defaulting in the future.\n\nWork History and Income Requirements\n\nYou must have be employed continuously for at least two years to secure an HUD loan. Job changes are permitted, but your chances of approval will be better if you have stayed with the same employer. Your income should have remained the same or increased during this two-year period of employment. Your monthly loan-related expenses should not be more than 29 percent of your gross income.\n\n\n\nInclude all costs paid for mortgage insurance, property taxes and homeowner's insurance when calculating your income-to-debt ratio. For example, if your mortgage payment will be $500 per month, property tax impound payments are $100 per month and insurance premiums are $75 per month, your total monthly loan-related expenses will total $675.\n\nExisting Debts and Liens\n\nAll outstanding accounts with collection agencies and court judgments against you must be resolved before you can close your loan. You may be approved with open collection accounts, so long as they are completely paid off on the loan closing date. You must pay any state tax liens in full. Federal tax liens may be paid on a payment plan, as long as you can still meet the FHA's income-to-debt ratio with the addition of the tax payment. If you have filed for bankruptcy, at least two years must have passed since your discharge. After a foreclosure, you must wait three years and avoid any future 30-day late payments.\n\n\n\nMinimum Property Standards\n\nThe property itself also is subject to certain minimum requirements. The FHA wants to ensure that the home it receives as collateral for the loan is structurally sound and will hold its value if the lender is forced to sell it after a default. A licensed appraiser must examine the home and attest that it is safe and habitable. The main areas of concern are the electrical wiring, heating and air conditioning, roof, water heater, structure and appliances.\n\nLoan Limits\n\nThe maximum loan amount varies by county and type of property, due to regional differences in home prices. For example, the maximum loan amount for a single-family home in San Francisco is $625,500, while the maximum in Fresno County is $281,750 for single-family homes. Multi-family homes may be secured by larger loans. A four-plex in San Francisco may be secured by a loan of up to $1,202,925, for example.\n\nHow to Apply for a HUD Loan\n\nThe application process for FHA loans is similar to a traditional mortgage. You will be asked for your employment history, proof of income and a list of your assets. You also must consent to a credit check. If you prefer to apply online, you may do so directly from the FHA's website. You can also request preapproval to make home-buying process easier. Many sellers will treat a preapproval similar to a cash purchase, and offer you favorable terms to close the sale quickly."}
{"title": "How to Get a Power of Attorney in Georgia", "text": "People sometimes need to have others perform tasks on their behalf. In many situations, these tasks can only be completed by someone who receives power of attorney. In Georgia, you can only be given power of attorney through a written document signed by the person granting you the power, known as the principal. Always talk to a lawyer if you need legal advice or have questions about any specific power of attorney issues in Georgia.\n\nGerogia power of attorney must be conveyed through writing.\n\nDocumentation\n\nPowers of attorney can only be conveyed through writing. Georgia Code sections 10-6-142 and 31-36-10 provide examples of power of attorney forms that contains all the required language, they are not the only kind of POA that can be used. The keys to any power of attorney in the state are: that it is in writing, it names the parties, details the powers passed, is signed by the principal, witnessed by two people or notarized.\n\nCapacity\n\nA principal can only give you power of attorney if he is capable of doing so, meaning he must be of sound mind. A person of sound mind is able to understand his actions, know what he is granting and be able to revoke it if he so chooses. Typically, if a principal loses his ability to make decisions, the power of attorney terminates automatically. However, a durable power of attorney continues to allow you to act even if the principal is no longer of sound mind.\n\nLimitations\n\nYour ability to act on behalf of the principal is limited by two key elements: time and the terms of the power of attorney. Powers of attorney last for one of two time periods: as long as the principal decides or as long as the principal is alive. If the principal wants to terminate your power at any time, he can do so. Also, no power of attorney lasts beyond the principal's death. Further, the terms of the power of attorney can place specific limits on your power to as much or as little an extent as the principal desires. Also, only people of sound mind can grant valid POA. Anyone who is not of sound mind is not legally capable of granting power of attorney.\n\nGrant of Power\n\nYour right to make decisions under a power of attorney takes place in one of two situations: when the principal signs the document or, after signing, when a specified event takes place. The specified event can be anything the principal decided, and must be included in the power of attorney document. For example, if the principal wants you to take over his financial responsibilities if he becomes so sick he can no longer make decisions, the power of attorney must specify this. If it does not specify, the power of attorney takes effect immediately."}

{"title": "How to Report Income on Your Credit Card Application", "text": "If you have a job with a fixed annual salary, reporting your income on credit card applications is easy. But for millions of students, stay-at-home parents, hourly-wage workers and freelancers, reporting annual income is much trickier.\nYou want to tell the truth, but the applications rarely make it clear how you should calculate such a number. What\u2019s an honest consumer to do?\nWhat counts as income\nBefore the Credit CARD Act of 2009, it seemed as though everyone with a pulse could get a big credit line. Today, that\u2019s no longer the case. The CARD Act requires lenders to extend credit only when they believe the borrower has the ability to repay it. The income you report on your credit card application is one way creditors decide how much credit they should extend to you, if any.\nAccording to an amendment to the CARD Act, borrowers over 21 can list any income to which they have \u201creasonable expectation of access.\u201d This broad definition includes:\nPersonal income\nIncome from a spouse or partner\nAllowances and gifts\nTrust fund distributions\nScholarships and grants\nRetirement fund distributions\nSocial Security income\nBorrowers between ages 18 and 21 can report only independent income, which typically includes:\nPersonal income, including regular allowances\nScholarships and grants\nRight now, there are no specific legal guidelines about how irregular income should be calculated. But generally, you should report only income that can be verified by tax returns, a letter or some other document.\n\u201cUse common sense,\u201d says Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. \u201cIf you can\u2019t prove the income exists, you shouldn\u2019t list it.\u201d\nRemember, when your issuer assigns you a credit limit based on your income, it\u2019s not a trust fall. If you default, your creditor won\u2019t be there to catch you; it\u2019ll be asking for its money back.\nMORE: NerdWallet\u2019s Best Credit Cards for College Students\nWhat doesn\u2019t count as income\nIt\u2019s not a good idea to state borrowed money, including student loans, as income. Although there\u2019s no specific law against it, such reporting would go against the spirit and intent of the \u201cability to pay\u201d clause in the CARD Act, Rheingold says, and could hurt your finances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s debt, it\u2019s not income,\u201d he says of borrowed money. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s a really bad idea, bordering on the absurd.\u201d\nWhen the loans come due, paying back the balances on your cards could prove difficult."}
{"title": "Metal Profile: Dysprosium", "text": "Dysprosium metal is a soft, lustrous-silver rare earth element (REE) that is used in permanent magnets due to its paramagnetic strength and high-temperature durability.Properties:Atomic Symbol: DyAtomic Number: 66Element Category: Lanthanide metalAtomic Weight: 162.50Melting Point: 1412\u00b0CBoiling Point: 2567\u00b0CDensity: 8.551g/cm3 Vickers Hardness: 540 MPaCharacteristics:While relatively stable in air at ambient temperatures, dysprosium metal will react with cold water and rapidly dissolves in contact with acids. In hydrofluoric acid, however, the heavy rare earth metal will form a protective layer of dysprosium fluoride (DyF3).The soft, silver-colored metal's main application is in permanent magnets. This is due to the fact that pure dysprosium is strongly paramagnetic above -93\u00b0C (-136\u00b0F), meaning it is attracted to magnetic fields within a wide range of temperatures.Along with holmium, dysprosium also has the highest magnetic moment (the strength and direction of pull resulting affected by a magnetic field) of any element.Dysprosium's high melting temperature and neutron absorption cross section also allow it to be used in nuclear control rods.While dysprosium will machine without sparking, it is not commercially used as a pure metal or in structural alloys.Like other lanthanide (or rare earth) elements, dysprosium is most often naturally associated in ore bodies with other rare earth elements.History:The French chemist Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbadran first recognized dysprosium as an independent element in 1886 while he was analyzing erbium oxide.Reflecting the intimate nature of REEs, de Boisbaudran was initially investigating impure yttrium oxide, from which he drew erbium and terbium using acid and ammonia. Erbium oxide, itself, was found to be harboring two other elements, holmium, and thulium.As de Boisbaudran worked on away at his home, the elements began to reveal themselves like Russian dolls, and after 32 acid sequences and 26 ammonia precipitations, de Boisbaudran was able to identify dysprosium as a unique element. He named the new element after the Greek word dysprositos, meaning 'hard to get'.More pure forms of the element were prepared in 1906 by Georges Urbain, while a pure form (by today's standards) of the element was not produced until 1950, after the development of io- exchange separation and metallographic reduction techniques by Frank Harold Spedding, a pioneer of rare earth research, and his team at Ames Laboratory.The Ames Laboratory, along with the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, was also central in developing one of the first major uses for dysprosium, Terfenol-D. The magnetostrictive material was researched during the 1970s and commercialized in the 1980s for use in naval sonars, magnetomechanical sensors, actuators and transducers.Dysprosium's use in permanent magnets also grew with the creation of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in the 1980s. Research by General Motors and Sumitomo Special Metals led to the creation of these stronger, cheaper versions of the first permanent (samarium-cobalt) magnets, which had been developed 20 years earlier.The addition of between 3 to 6 percent dysprosium (by weight) to the NdFeB magnetic alloy increases the magnet's Curie point and coercivity, thereby, improving stability and performance at high temperatures while also reducing demagnetization.NdFeB magnets are now the standard in electronic applications and hybrid electric vehicles.The REEs, including dysprosium, were thrust into the global media spotlight in 2009 after limits on Chinese exports of the elements led to supply shortfalls and investor interest in the metals. This, in turn, led to rapidly increasing prices and significant investment in the development of alternative sources.Production:Recent media attention examining global dependence on Chinese REE production often highlights the fact that the country accounts for roughly 90% of global REE production.While a number of ore types, including monazite and bastnasite, may contain dysprosium, the sources with the highest percentage of contained dysprosium are the ion adsorption clays of Jiangxi Province, China and xenotime ores in South China and Malaysia.Depending upon the type of ore, a variety of hydrometallurgical techniques must be employed in order to extract individual REEs. Froth flotation and roasting of concentrates is most the most common method of extracting rare earth sulphate, a precursor compound that can consequently be processed via ion exchange displacement. The resulting dysprosium ions are then stabilized with fluorine to form dysprosium fluoride.Dysprosium fluoride can be reduced into metal ingots by heating with calcium at high temperatures in tantalum crucibles.Global production of dysprosium is limited to about 1800 metric tonnes (contained dysprosium) annually. This accounts for only about 1 percent of all rare earth refined each year.The largest rare earth producers include Baotou Steel Rare Earth Hi-Tech Co., China Minmetals Corp., and Aluminum Corp. of China (CHALCO).Applications:By far, the largest consumer of dysprosium is the permanent magnet industry. Such magnets dominate the market for high-efficiency traction motors that are used in hybrid and electric vehicles, wind turbine generators and hard disc drives.Click here to read more about dysprosium applications.

{"title": "Differences Between a Totten Trust & a Payable-on-Death Account", "text": "The terms \u201cTotten trusts\u201d and \u201cpayable-on-death account\u201d represent different names for the same thing: an informal revocable trust. Both Totten trusts and payable-on-death accounts are deposit accounts -- held at a bank, credit union, savings and loan or other financial institution -- that transfer to designated beneficiaries upon the account owner's death. Different states, or even different financial institutions within the same state, may refer to such accounts as payable-on-death accounts or as Totten trusts.The term \u201cTotten trust\u201d stems from a 1904 New York state lawsuit, namely Matter of Totten (179 NY 112 [1904]). This case represents the first court ruling that allowed an the establishment of a bank deposit account in trust for a beneficiary, who had no rights to the funds until the depositor\u2019s death. Prior to the Totten case, similar lawsuits had ruled that such accounts were essentially attempts to establish a will without fulfilling the legal requirements that a will entails. Though the initial New York ruling referred to this type of account as a revocable or tentative trust, over time these accounts became known as Totten trusts or payable-on-death accounts.Several subsequent lawsuits challenged the Totten ruling on matters such as whether or not the beneficiary should receive an account passbook and whether an oral directive or a will could revoke a trust. In New York, these matters weren\u2019t conclusively answered until 1975, when laws passed specifying that Totten trusts could only be revoked during the depositor\u2019s lifetime by removing funds from an account and in a will only through an explicit direction. In 1985, a further statute allowed termination or modification of a Totten trust through written instruction filed with the holding financial institution. Many other states have explicit legislation surrounding how to revoke or modify a Totten Trust.Payable-on-death accounts offer several benefits; foremost among them is hease. Account holders simply file the account beneficiary\u2019s name with the bank -- an easy, free process. Totten trusts also keep money out of probate. According to NOLO.com, these types of accounts are often referred to as \u201cpoor man\u2019s trusts\u201d in that they allow funds to pass directly to beneficiaries after the account holder\u2019s death, without the need to hire legal assistance to create a trust. Accounts can hold investment share certificates, share accounts and stock deposits as well as funds, all of which pass directly to the beneficiary after the account holder\u2019s death.In most cases, revoking a Totten Trust is simple. The account owner can withdraw funds, close the account or name another beneficiary."}
{"title": "New Grad? Ever Thought of Freelance Writing?", "text": "Question: Freelance Writing and the New GraduateDear Writer,I am graduating in a week and not interested in the publishers and magazines recruiting at my college's career fairs. What I am interested in is establishing a freelance writing business. What advice would you give a new grad looking to freelance right out of college?Answer:Hi Student,What an incredible, excellent question! I've not got this one yet!I've heard time and again that your generation is a generation of entrepreneurs who are independent workers interested in building their own future. Those are great characteristics for someone wishing to be a freelance writer. BUT, before you make the decision, I want you to consider a couple factors.First and foremost, you should definitely give some thought to the issues of insurance and regular pay. You are lucky in that the new health care reform allows you to stay on your parents' health insurance for a short while. That would be a great honeymoon period to set up a freelance career. However, that doesn't solve the issue of erratic and unpredictable pay checks. It's definitely a serious pain and quite difficult to live on that kind of spotty income ALONE. These are two issues that many freelancers lean on a spouse for, which is an option many college grads won't yet have.Another thing I want you to consider is that it may be important for you to work in a traditional job before you freelance, and here's why: the people that I freelance for are all in traditional offices. So, I need to be able to relate to them, understand their point of view, adapt to their schedules, know their needs, relate to their stressors, and so on. You have to be sensitive to your clients, and I'm not sure you can do so without having seen that side of work life.Another issue is how to build up clientele. Many a freelancer's first clients were contacts made in the work world. Without that network, you're at a disadvantage from the start. Sure, you can try to make do with social media, LinkedIn and so on, but no one wants to start a career at a disadvantage.In conclusion, I would honestly recommend that you see if you can get a little experience within a publisher before you freelance. My own clients are often quite interested in my past work with big-name publishers, so those are great names to have on your resume if you have the opportunity. You can always take on freelance work on the side in preparation for your eventual launch!Thanks for the great question!"}

{"title": "Tax Terms: Understanding the Flat Tax System", "text": "The \"flat tax\" is an income tax system in which everyone pays the same tax rate regardless of income. These systems are in place in eight U.S. states as of 2016, but legislation is afoot in at least one state to change to a progressive system. The Flat Tax Simplifies Taxation Advocates of the flat tax system contend that it's fair because everyone pays the same tax rate. This system eliminates deductions, tax credits and most exemptions, which in theory curbs biases toward certain behaviors and activities. It also simplifies the tax code, making compliance easier. Some proponents would like to see Federal Form 1040 replaced by a simple post card on which you would write your wages and multiply it by one tax rate.Only Earned Income Is Taxed Another aspect of this tax philosophy removes double taxation by taxing only taxing income. Dividends, interest on savings, and capital gains that result from investment or increases in asset value are not taxed under a pure flat tax system. This is intended to encourage investment.Economic Growth and the Flat TaxSupporters of a flat tax system claim that it encourages economic growth by avoiding a system in which earners with higher incomes are penalized for being productive and earning more money. They argue that a progressive tax creates penalties for things like hard work, risk-taking and entrepreneurship. The flat tax is supposed to avoid this by taxing every dollar at the same rate.At the state level, reducing the top income tax rate by moving to a lower flat tax rate is thought to attract and encourage business investment and to bring in high-income individuals, increasing overall tax revenue and economic stability.Arguments Against a Flat Tax System Opponents argue that a flat tax system places an undue burden on the lower and middle class by removing deductions and expanding the tax base to include every level of income. They claim that moving to such a system shifts the tax burden from the rich to the poor, those who are most affected by taxation and who are the least able to pay. They contend that the working class supports the idle rich when unearned income is exempted. Some flat tax systems in the U.S. get around this by exempting individuals who fall below certain income levels and by offering special exemptions or tax credits for low-income individuals.  Opponents of the flat tax argue that progressive tax systems are fair because they tax disposable earnings -- income minus certain deductible expenses. They argue that the wealthy should pay more because they have more disposable income and therefore a greater ability to pay, and that the economy would be better stimulated by decreasing taxes on the middle class, who make up the largest part of the general public. This would give more people additional disposable income to spend on products.Also see:  List of Flat Tax StatesSources: Heritage Foundation (a conservative research and education foundation); Tax Policy Center (a nonpartisan research institute)"}

{"title": "The Role of An Enrolled Agent", "text": "Many business people are not aware of what an Enrolled Agent (EA) is, or how an Enrolled Agent can help with business taxes. Kirk Ward, an Enrolled Agent, answers your questions:What is an Enrolled Agent?According to the National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA):EA is the professional designation for an Enrolled Agent. After the Civil War, many citizens had problems settling claims with the government for horses and other property confiscated for use in the war effort. After many petitions and much pleading, Congress in 1884 endowed Enrolled Agents with the power of advocacy to prepare claims against the government and to seek equitable justice for the citizenry. For many years, the purpose of the Enrolled Agent was to act in this capacity.In 1913, when the income tax was passed, the job of the Enrolled Agent was expanded to include claims for monetary relief for citizens whose taxes had become inequitable. As the income tax, estate, gift and other sources of tax collections became more complex, the role of the Enrolled Agent increased to include the preparation of the many tax forms that were required. Additionally, as audits became more prevalent, their role evolved into taxpayer advocacy, negotiating with the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of their clients.How does someone get to be certified as an EA?The \"Enrolled Agent\" credential is not a \"certification,\" although it is regularly referred to as such by many practitioners, including the NAEA. The IRS has been keen to point this out and note that it is also not a \"license.\" However, it can be thought of as an \"earned credential,\" bestowed by the Treasury Department, through the IRS. I say it is \"earned,\" because it will not be bestowed unless the individual passes a rigorous test of tax law.The EA test is on tax law, which distinguishes it significantly from the CPA (certified public accountant) exam which is almost exclusively on accounting and auditing rules and procedures, specifically designed to facilitate the interpretation of financial statements. This financial statement interpretation generally has no relevance to tax law except as to how tax obligations are presented in the financial statement, not how the taxes are calculated.An EA designation can also be awarded by the IRS based on five years employment with the IRS, in a position where the individual regularly interpreted and applied tax law. This would not include the folks who answer the 1-800-tax-1040 advice line.All candidates are subject to an IRS background check and are subject to being \"disbarred\" from practice before the IRS for misdeeds. An EA can also be disbarred for failing to meet their continuing education requirements.How long does it take to become an EA?I took the test back in the 90's. It was a two day four-part exam, but the entire process took about a year, from the time I registered to take the exam, through the taking of the exam, to the grading of the exam and issuance of the credential or \"Certificate of Enrollment.\"Currently, the exam is given in three parts at over 300 locations across the US. Candidates are allowed to take one or all parts of the exam at the time of their choosing during a period, usually ranging from May through February of the next year.What can EA's do?Enrolled Agents are specifically authorized to represent taxpayers before the IRS at all administrative levels, up to, but not including Tax Court. Only attorneys and individuals who have passed the \"Tax Court Exam For Non-Attorneys\" are authorized to argue cases before Tax Court.Most Enrolled Agents operate accounting practices and compete directly with CPA's, bookkeepers and other accountants. Because their enrollment is a federal designation, they can work across state borders, whereas CPA's and attorneys must meet the reciprocity requirements of any state they wish to practice in.What can Enrolled Agents NOT do?While Enrolled Agents do perform accounting tasks, and may perform certain kinds of audits, they are limited in that they cannot express an \"unqualified\" type of opinion, such as a public company would need when filing their financial statements with the Securities & Exchange Commission. Having SEC compliant audited statements is not a requirement for most small non-public businesses.Can someone make a living as an EA?Another organization, the National Society of Accountants (NSA) reports that approximately 50% of its members are Enrolled Agents. They also report that in 2005, the average practitioner in small rural communities had practice revenue of approximately $140,000 and a net profit to the owner of approximately $60,000. Large city practitioners were approximately double that amount.What would a small business owner use an EA for?An EA can prepare your business taxes and represent you before the IRS if you are audited; you can also use an EA for accounting tasks. I would also note that most small business owners would be better served if they were to consider an Enrolled Agent. As I stated earlier, to the best of my knowledge, there are NO questions on tax law on the CPA exam, only questions on the accounting treatment of tax obligations. And, since there are no small privately held businesses I know of that are required to file their financial statements with the SEC, this all the more reason to consider a professional who has been tested on the business owner's main concern, taxes.How much does an EA charge?Like any professional, as much as they can get by with. However, the NSA's 2006 Survey of Income and Fees states that the national average charged by their members is approximately $75 per hour for regular monthly accounting. Typically, an individual income tax return with itemized deductions is under $250.Kirk Ward is an Enrolled Agent at  Kirk-Ward.com ."}
{"title": "Is an IRA the Same as a 401K?", "text": "401k plans and individual retirement accounts both offer tax-preferred savings for retirement, and have similar rules concerning contributions and withdrawals. The two plans differ in several ways, however, the largest being that a 410k plan is sponsored by an employer for employees, while an IRA is set up by individuals.\n\nPlan Basics\n\nIn their traditional forms, 401k plans and IRAs allow savers to deposit money and defer paying taxes on those contributions and their earnings until the money is withdrawn after age 59 1/2. 401k plans are set up by an employer on behalf of employees. Employees can defer part of their pay, pretax, and employers can contribute to the plan as well. IRAs are set up by individuals who make deposits and take a tax deduction for them.\n\nContributions\n\nThere are limits to the amount of contributions you can deposit to both a 401k plan and an IRA, although they are very different. In 2011, employees under age 55 can defer up to $16,500 of their wages into a 401k plan, and add $5,500 if they are over 55. Employers can add matching or other contributions as well. IRA contribution limits are much lower: $5,000 for those under 55 with an additional $1,000 for those older. The entire value of an employee 401k contribution is not taxed until withdrawal, while the total amount of your IRA contribution that you can deduct may be limited if you participate in both a 401k and an IRA, or if your income is above certain levels.\n\nDistributions\n\nIn general, distributions from either plan will incur a tax penalty if you withdraw them before age 59 1/2. There are some exceptions to this rule -- if you rollover the withdrawal to another qualified plan, a 401k or IRA, or if you become disabled, have a medical hardship, or take periodic payments for no less than five years. Some 401k plans allow participants to withdraw funds, with a penalty, if they have a financial hardship or are purchasing a home; some plans also allow participants to take loans. IRA owners may withdraw funds for a first time home purchase or qualified educational expenses without incurring a penalty. You cannot take a loan from an IRA. For traditional IRAs and 401k plans, you must begin taking distributions by age 79 1/2.\n\nRoth Option\n\nIRAs and some 401k plans may be set up as Roth plans. For these plans, contributions are taxed in the year of deposit, but earnings are never taxed, provided they are withdrawn by the Roth IRA and 401k rules. These withdrawal rules are essentially the same as those for traditional plans, but do not have a required distribution date during the owner's lifetime."}
{"title": "Best Tips to Get Your Song on the Radio", "text": "How can I get my song on the radio? This question is a deceptive one - it seems straightforward enough, and on the surface, there is a straightforward answer. To get your song played on the radio, either you or your radio promotion company approaches program directors/music directors at radio stations, promotes your song to them using a combination of press releases/one-sheets, phone calls and faxes, and then the stations that are interesting in the song will play it and the ones who aren't won't. Sounds pretty easy, right?Radio PromotionThe truth is that radio promotion is ANYTHING but easy. Getting onto radio is incredibly competitive, and when it comes to large commercial radio stations in major radio markets, getting on the playlist may be downright impossible for musicians outside of the major label system. That doesn't mean that SOME radio play is out of reach if you don't have a big budget and big movers and shakers behind your song. It does mean, however, that you need to understand a few things about the world of radio if you ever hope to turn the dial and hear your song coming out of the speakers.Non-Commercial RadioFirst things first - there are two kinds of radio: non-commercial radio (non-comm) and commercial radio. Non-commercial radio encompasses college radio and community radio stations (including NPR stations) and commercial radio is everything else (in other words, the stations with lots of commercials!). Non-commercial radio is the most likely starting place for an up and coming independent artist. College radio is VERY friendly to such artists, and community radio stations often are as well. Don't feel like getting plays on this kind of radio is somehow \"less\" than getting played on a commercial station. Some non-comm stations are hugely popular, and further, succeeding in the non-comm arena can lead commercial radio stations to take notice.Commercial RadioAfter non-comm, independent artists often turn to small commercial radio stations (for a lesson on radio markets, read What Are Radio Station Markets. In this way, getting songs played on the radio is a bit like building blocks. You develop a foundation of plays on non-comm radio, which you use to build up to small commercial stations, which may, in turn, lead to play at medium stations and so on and so forth. However, it is important to note that there is more to the process of moving up the radio ladder than just getting plays at smaller stations. Radio stations want to see your entire music career progressing along with your radio plays. If you aren't touring, picking up more and bigger pieces of press and selling an increasing amount of music, then larger stations aren't going to play your song. Why? They judge your songs on their ability to increase their ratings by playing your music, not on the song quality itself. Showing bigger stations that your whole career is growing, show them that you're a good rating risk since you're probably on their audience's radar.Radio CampaignNow, how do you actually run a radio campaign? You need at least four weeks in advance of your add date to run a decent campaign, and a few extra weeks may be in order if you're new to the game. During the start of your radio promotion push, you'll mail out promo CDs to all of the program directors of the stations that you're targeting. After that, you'll spend a week or so confirming your packages were received, soliciting initial feedback and re-sending any promos that went MIA. The next few weeks will be spent soliciting feedback about the single while trying to get commitments from stations saying that they will be adding the single - or, indeed, that they won't be. All the while, you'll be updating the program director with news about the musicians relevant to that market - shows, sales and so on. At this stage, you may also place ads in radio trade publication announcing the single and that you're going for adds - especially if you're going for plays in larger markets. During the last week of the campaign, you'll do a final push for adds and then wait for the results to come in. That's a short rendition of the process, but that's it in a nutshell - and that's the same process used to promote to non-comm radio right up to the top major station in a large market.The Bottom LineThe bottom line? The best way to get your song on the radio is to approach the radio stations that are appropriate for your stage of career. If you're just trying to break into radio, focus on the non-comms and take it from there. Some artists never get played anywhere but college radio and thrive in their music careers. Build a realistic, easily managed radio campaign, and you'll start to see success on the airwaves."}
{"title": "Read These SEVEN Great Advertising Books", "text": "I have a particular fondness for this book because I was lucky enough to work under Steve Harrison in London. To this day, over a decade later, I still find myself parroting Steve's words to other people, and correcting my copy over and over again. The time I spent with Steve, one of the best creative directors in the business, was priceless. The reason is simple; Steve cuts through the bull and gives it to you straight. What's more, he doesn't just explain the problems, but offers skillful solutions. In the book, you'll learn what it takes to be an effective creative, which means coming up with great ideas that actually sell. He also explains the principles of brand-building, creative presentations, how to be a creative director and how to run a successful business. It's all done in a way that's both easy to read, and impossible to forget. Filled with examples of some of the best advertising and direct marketing (often overlooked by the snobs of the industry), this is essential reading. This is now on record as being the most expensive book on advertising ever sold, with prices hitting over \u00a33,400 a copy. That's over $4,000 at the current exchange rate. Since then, things have calmed down, but it's still only available from private sellers for around the $100 mark. And it is worth every red cent. (By the way, if you ever read this Steve, thanks for the best learning experience I ever had. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.)Trott is a living legend in the advertising business, with a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue. He's not afraid to tell it like it is, and sometimes his words feel like a smack around the earlobe. But a well-deserved one. He opened one of the most anti-establishment ad agencies of the 1980s - GGT. Its work was so breakthrough and unavoidable, it even got death threats from the Ayatollah Khomeini and some unwanted attention from the Kray twins. Now, in Creative Mischief, the master of mayhem tells you how to do advertising the right way and run an ad agency. You'll learn about the importance of making sure your advertising gets noticed (which seems odd to say, but so few ads actually do breakthrough the clutter). You'll find out how to make ads memorable. And you'll have a ton of laughs in the process. A great book, highly recommended.A founding partner of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, one of the world's most influential and important advertising agencies, John Hegarty is an icon. Now, he shares what he has learned about advertising, design, London and everything in between. As Hegarty is no fan of copy (he's famously said \"words are a barrier to communication\") it must have been tough for him to fill a book full of it. But he does it with real style, humor and irreverence. And if you're in any business that involves advertising, you'll find it a book that you find difficult to put down. In particular, the chapter on how to be a creative director is golden. It's short, to the point and demands multiple reads. Get this book. Buy copies for friends. One of the greatest living copywriters, Neil French got into advertising the old fashioned way; namely, he just fell into it when no other professions suited him. Lucky for us he turned out to be a fantastic writer who can twist copy and prose like an Olympic gymnast. The book charts Neil's life and career, with chapters devoted to his stint as a bullfighter, his time spent in account management, the formation of his first ad agency, and the subsequent controversies that surrounded him. As much an autobiography as it is a manual on advertising, it's both funny and cutting in equal measure. At $50 it's not cheap, but for the wisdom is provides, it's a steal.An updated and redesigned edition of the original D&AD Copy Book, which went out of print long ago, this new version now includes work produced in the last 15 years. As with its predecessor, the book contains essays by some of the best copywriters in the advertising industry. They include David Abbott, Lionel Hunt, Steve Hayden, Dan Wieden, Neil French, Mike Lescarbeau, Adrian Holmes, and Barbara Nokes. Each copywriting superstar reveals how they work, why they do what they do, and how you can be a better writer or creative. It's also filled with dozens of examples of their work. Buy this, refer to it often, be inspired, and maybe one day you'll grace the pages of the next edition.Another book by Dave Trott? Yes. In fact, every book ever written by the great Mr. Trott is a must read, and this one is no exception. Dave can weave a story with the perfect amount of humor and insight, and it makes reading his books an absolute breeze. In fact, if you have a weekend free, you'll finish this one with ease, and go back and read it again. Filled with incredible stories from his career, plus prime examples from history, this is a masterclass in creative thinking, and lateral problem-solving. And everyone who reads this book suddenly finds themselves inspired to do better work, and do more of it. It's not just a fire starter, it's a nuclear catalyst. Ignore this at your own peril. Chances are, you won't have heard much, if anything, about the late great Howard Gossage. To say he was a tremendous influence on modern advertising would be akin to saying The Beatles were a somewhat inspiring to a generation. Gossage was not an ad man in the traditional sense. He was certainly not someone as that was as easy to pin down as Bill Bernbach or Leo Burnett, who were masters of their craft, but focused on a particular type of communication. Gossage was a writer, a thinker, a philosopher, and he was decades ahead of his time. In fact, many of the techniques we use today in guerrilla, social media, and interactive advertising can be traced back to his methodologies. He was a brilliant man. And writing about him, another brilliant man - Steve Harrison. Having won more Cannes Direct Lions than any other person on this planet, he knows his stuff. Get this book."}

{"title": "List of Minimum Wage Rates for 2017", "text": "What is the minimum wage for 2017? The minimum wage rate is the lowest hourly pay that can be awarded to workers, also known as a pay floor. The Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) determines the minimum wage for employees in private and public sectors, in both Federal and State governments. Under the FLSA, non-exempt employees must be paid the minimum wage or higher. Federal Minimum WageThe current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, and has not increased since July 2009.However, some states have a higher minimum wage rate. When the state minimum wage rate is higher than the federal rate, employers are required to pay workers the higher amount. Currently, there are no official decisions on an increased federal minimum wage in 2017. With that said, this year the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) enacted legislation that employees with federal contracts must be paid at least $10.20 per hour, beginning January 1, 2017. Likewise, tipped employees connected to federal contracts must be paid a cash wage of at least $6.80 per hour.Exemptions from Minimum WagePlease note that some employees are exempt from minimum wage requirements, such as those who are not protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act, tipped employees such as waitstaff, for example, and others can be paid at a lower rate than minimum wage.State Minimum Wage RatesIn a few states, the minimum wage varies from one city or county to another.For example, the minimum wage for Los Angeles and Chicago is higher than the hourly rate in California or Illinois. This variance is due to differences in the cost of living, usually in urban communities.Projected minimum wage rates for 2017 (and in some cases, 2018 and 2019) have been released in some states. However, not all rates will be effective at the start of the calendar year. Some cities and states have instead scheduled increases in the minimum wage to take place at various times during the year.In Maryland, for example, the minimum wage for 2017 is initially set at $9.25 starting July 1, 2017, and is slated for an increase to $10.10 effective July 1st, 2018. At the current time, 29 states have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage ($7.25/hour), and five states have not set a state minimum wage. These states include Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Minimum Wage Rates for 2017 Listed by StateThe following is a list of minimum wage rates for each state for 2017 announced, to date. The list also includes scheduled increases for future years.Please Note: Some states, indicated by an asterisk, adjust their rate annually based on the cost of living. In those cases, the figure listed is an estimate pending that adjustment. In addition, some cities, counties, state governments, and companies have higher minimum wage rates than the state minimum.Minimum wage rates may change during the calendar year.

{"title": "Does Wife's Social Security Change At My Retirement?", "text": "Dear Senior Living Adviser,\nI\u2019m 65 and working. My wife retired at age 62 and started receiving Social Security at that age. It\u2019s my understanding that when I reach my full retirement of 66, I can file for Social Security retirement benefits and then immediately suspend them.\nThen, while I continue to work, this will allow my wife to claim a spousal benefit that is half of my full retirement benefit in lieu of her current benefit as mine continues to grow. Is that correct?\n\u2014 Jim Juncture\nDear Jim,\nThat\u2019s not correct. When your wife filed for Social Security benefits at age 62, her benefits were calculated based on her work record and, if the spousal benefit would be higher, she is paid a higher benefit, but it\u2019s a combination of the two benefits. She doesn\u2019t get to reset her benefits when you reach full retirement age.\nHere\u2019s what the Social Security Administration says on its website: \u201cIf your spouse is eligible for retirement benefits on his or her own record, we will pay that amount first. But if the benefit on your record is a higher amount, he or she will get a combination of benefits that equals that higher amount (reduced for age).\u201d\nIf you start receiving benefits between age 62 and your full retirement age, the amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to your full retirement age.\nYou can file and suspend at your full retirement age of 66 and earn delayed retirement benefits up to age 70. If you choose to do that, your benefit will be 132 percent of your full retirement benefit at age 66.\nIf you do file and suspend, you have the option to change your mind and can receive benefits back to when you first filed, although you won\u2019t capture the delayed retirement credits.\nShould you die before your wife, her survivors benefit will be based on your Social Security benefit and should be 100 percent of your retirement benefit at the time of your death. Until then, her benefit is based on her decision to file at age 62.\nAsk the adviser To ask a question of Dr. Don, go to the \u201cAsk the Experts\u201d page and select one of these topics: \u201cSenior Living,\u201d \u201cFinancing a home,\u201d \u201cSaving & Investing\u201d or \u201cMoney.\u201d Read more Dr. Don columns for additional personal finance advice.\nBankrate\u2019s content, including the guidance of its advice-and-expert columns and this website, is intended only to assist you with financial decisions.

{"title": "Markdowns Cost Money", "text": "Markdowns are the discount you take on merchandise in your retail store from the original sale price marked. Compared to a sale or promotional event, a markdown (in its purest form) is when you change the list price to a lowered price permanently. For Example: If you have a tennis raquet on your shelf that is listed at $300 and you decide to change the list price to $250, you have just taken a $50 markdown. You do this because the raquet has been on the shelf for too long and it is time to get it out the door. When you first bought it, you paid $150. So your IMU was $150 or double the cost. This is referred to as keystone pricing. Now, when you sell it, you will not get 50% gross margin; the new markdown price will yield a 40% margin. When I was on the board of governors at the University of North Texas, we were asked to review the degree plan for retail buyers. One thing that jumped out at me right away was the lack of math. In fact, there were only three hours of math (one class) required to earn a degree as a retail buyer. In my 26 years of retail, the one thing I learned (over and over) was that buying was 10% \"fashion eye\" and 90% math. In other words, it was more about planning to get rid of the merchandise before you bought it. If you do not understand the math and the reality that you will have to markdown a % of the items you purchased, then you will leave lots of money on the table. Retail buying is about math not \"eye.\" It's about planning for the good and the bad. We tend to fall in love with our buying decisions (I know I did) - sometimes to the detriment of our store. Markdowns are inevitable. But markdowns done right can be healthy. They keep the store fresh and inviting. Many retail store owners think they can sell the item for the original price \"if they just give it a little more time.\" Customers vote early on your merchandise. Be smart and markdown items sooner rather than later. To help with this, use a calendar. Plan your markdowns to occur after the items have been in the store for a certain period of time. In my shoe stores, we automatically marked down an item after 60 days (if it was not a regular, replenishable item.) Then we took the next markdown at 90 days and then the final one at 120. This process put pressure on me as the owner to use an open-to-buy system that kept my inventory in check. It also kept inventory from becoming so old that I got nothing for it. As a general rule, use the following model I like to call the Rule of 1/3rds. If you buy 10 radios, then you will sell 1/3 at full price, 1/3 at 25% off and 1/3 at 60% off. If you do the math, you will quickly convince yourself to buy 7 versus 10 in the first place. In other words, the more backstock you have of an item the more likely it is to be marked down at some point. Another thing to consider when analyzing your markdowns is inventory turnover. There is a direct correlation between inventory turnover and markdowns. A high turnover usually means fewer markdowns. A lower inventory turn usually means higher or more markdowns. Last tip on markdowns, use dating on your purchases from the vendors to help your cash flow and offset the \"ding\" of markdowns when they happen. Dating is when the vendor gives you extra time to pay for the merchandise after it is delivered. For example, most invoices are due within 15 to 30 days after they are shipped to you. Dating is when the vendor gives you more time to pay. The benefit is that you might actually sell it before you have to pay for it!"}

{"title": "The Best Money Moves for Students in January", "text": "This month\u2019s spring semester kickoff is the best time to find your financial footing, from navigating credit cards for college students to creating a budget and filing taxes.\n\u201cBeing a new year and a new semester, college students can look at their financial situation through fresh eyes,\u201d says Ebeth Fielder, a spokesperson for Michigan First Credit Union and its Young & Free Michigan program. The program is designed to provide real-world financial and budgeting tips for college students.\nIn between late-night cram sessions, papers, parties, classes and the sweet dreams of spring break, there are some key moves you can make to improve your financial life.\nFile your FAFSA early\nThe U.S. Department of Education office of Federal Student Aid began accepting FAFSA applications on the first of the month, so now is the time to file. It may seem early, but since financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, you\u2019ll be ahead of the pack.\nSince you\u2019ll need tax return information for the current year in order to submit, you can choose to either use the previous year\u2019s tax returns or wait until you or your family files income taxes for the year. If you want to file early and you opt to use the previous year\u2019s return, you can return to your online form later to update with information from your new tax return.\nCreate a monthly budget\nStarting in January, you need to allocate every single penny you\u2019ll have for the month, then repeat the process each month, suggests Rachel Cruze, a personal finance expert and co-author of \u201cSmart Money Smart Kids.\u201d This means, laying out your income during the semester against expenses you expect to have.\n\u201cI know a budget doesn\u2019t sound like fun for most college students, but it\u2019s necessary,\u201d says Cruze, who describes a budget as something that simply tells your money what to do.\nThink about how much money you\u2019ll have for the month and divvy up where it goes. Include things like bills you have to pay (such as electricity or rent), food and activities. While you may allocate some money for discretionary spending, Fielder suggests looking at material purchases with a dollar sign in mind.\n\u201cWhen I got my first job and I was getting paid $7.50 an hour, it made me think twice about buying a T-shirt that cost $12,\u201d she said. \u201cChanging your perspective on how much things actually cost can make a difference when you make your budget.\u201d\nFind credit cards for college students\nThe bad news is, you can\u2019t get your own line of credit until you\u2019re 21 years old. But there is some good news: Once you reach the magic age, many credit card companies offer credit cards specifically designed for college students. These cards may not offer high limits, but they are easier to get if you don\u2019t have much credit history. The best ones typically have low annual percentage rates and no annual fees. Some even offer rewards tailored to student spending and for on-time payments or good grades. Compare the best student credit cards for rewards, interest rates, signup bonuses and fees. If you\u2019re having trouble getting a credit card, find a co-signer with a solid credit score and annual income to better your chances of getting approved.\nHowever, you have to establish healthy credit habits to avoid going into debt. First you need to get and review a copy of your credit report, suggests Rakesh Gupta, a professor at Adelphi University who teaches a seminar for freshman called \u201cYour Money AND Your Life.\u201d You can get your free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting agencies: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax.\nGupta also suggests that you:\nPay your bills on time.\nPay more than the minimum due on your credit card.\nKeep outstanding credit card balances low in relation to your credit limit.\nCheck your credit card statements carefully for errors or unauthorized charges.\nFind the best rates on loans\nWhen you are looking for a loan, be a savvy consumer and shop around for the best rate, suggests Valerie Moses, development specialist at CFE Federal Credit Union based in Florida. This means that you shouldn\u2019t necessarily accept the first loan you\u2019re offered.\n\u201cThe intimidation level college students deal with when it comes to financial institutions is overwhelming,\u201d Fielder says. \u201cI tell them they can\u2019t let themselves be intimidated by that because financial institutions want your business.\u201d\nWhen you\u2019re torn between a few different loans, use a student loan calculator to compare rates, monthly payments and more.\nWhile you\u2019re considering any loan, be cautious, advises Michael Clark, an Orlando-based certified financial planner. \u201cThe best advice I can give is for the student to ask someone older than them (like 5 years older) for advice and guidance about student loans,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the time, the person will explain any mistakes they may have made with student loans.\u201d\nTake advantage of tax credits\nTax-filing season starts Jan. 20, and there are two important tax credits the IRS offers that you might be eligible for that can help offset the costs of your education.\nThe American Opportunity Credit is available during your first two years of college, and has a maximum of $2,500 per student. The credit is available to people with a modified adjusted gross income of $80,000 or less for individuals and $160,000 for joint returns.\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for the American Opportunity Credit, Bill Hendricks, CEO and co-founder of the online tax software company Common Form, suggests students try to apply for the Lifetime Learning tax credit. It\u2019s available to students at any level \u2014 undergraduate, graduate or professional \u2014 and can be worth up to $2,000 in savings.\nYou can\u2019t apply for both credits in the same tax year, and you can\u2019t claim any credits if you claim a tuition and fees deduction in the same year. Only parents or students can claim the credit, but not both. You can claim either credit by completing Form 8863 and submitting it with your tax return."}
{"title": "5 tips for choosing a Medicare Part D plan", "text": "insurance\nGet out your wallets. The open enrollment period for 2012 Medicare Part D prescription drug plans started Oct. 15, 2011. If you're eager to save money this year, reviewing plan copays and out-of-pocket expenses -- besides premiums -- is crucial. Making a savvy choice can save you thousands of dollars per year. But you'll need to advocate for yourself because every plan is different, and costs may rise. In 2012, six of the top plans in the Medicare Part D market are raising premiums, according to a recent analysis from health policy firm Avalere Health LLC based in Washington, D.C. The drug plan unit of one large player, UnitedHealth Group, is raising 2012 premiums an average of 14 percent.\nThere's good news, though.\n\"Medicare Part D plans are becoming simpler and more cost-effective,\" says Steve Weisman, a senior lecturer of law, taxation and financial planning at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. \"Lots of companies have been weeded out.\"\nStart your search online\nFor 2012 plans, which start Jan. 1, the open enrollment period runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7, 2011. During this period, you can join, switch or drop your plan. And everyone with Medicare coverage can sign up for Part D.\nTo find a plan, search Medicare.gov. The interactive Medicare Plan Finder helps you compare deductibles and copays for your prescriptions under various plan scenarios. Input your own list of drugs into the Formulary Finder to make custom comparisons.\nAfter checking the Medicare.gov site, don't forget to reverify that your drugs will be covered, says Lita Epstein, author of \"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Medicare Part D.\" Sometimes there are mistakes on the site, she says, and changing your plan later isn't easy.\nWalgreens and other drugstore chains can also search plans if you can't do your own, says Epstein. Also, turn to pharmacists you trust, but avoid insurance brokers who may be pushing their own plans, she says.\nBefore making a final decision, heed these money-saving hints.\nCompare total annual drug costs. Totaling premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses are the best way to compare Medicare Part D costs, says Epstein. The exception is Medicare Advantage Plans, which are similar to health maintenance plans, in which drug costs are usually already folded into the plan. \"Make sure you compare apples with apples,\" she says.\nAt least 30 to 40 Medicare Part D options exist for consumers nearly everywhere, says Epstein. Before using the Medicare online tools, list every drug you're taking, including milligrams or dosage, for 30 days. Then narrow your choices to three plans, and compare them side by side, says Cindy Holtzman, founder of the advocacy firm Medical Refund Service in Marietta, Ga.\nKnow your formulary. Costs for drug formularies, which are lists of prescription drugs preferred by your health plan, can change every year. Brand-name drugs may have tiered cost sharing, and others may not be covered at all. Costs for expensive drugs can vary widely from plan to plan.\nSome plans require you to have prior physician authorizations for a particular drug, says Weisman.\nAvoid hitting the doughnut hole. The doughnut hole, which is a gap in Part D drug coverage, is getting smaller every year. In 2020, it will disappear. However, when you hit the doughnut hole in 2012, you'll pay 50 percent of the cost of brand-name formulary drugs after spending $2,930 until you reach the out-of-pocket threshold of $4,700 in 2012.\n\"You'll hit the doughnut hole if you're on three or four brand-name drugs,\" says Epstein. By moving to generics you can avoid it, she says. Another option: wholesale clubs that let you use their pharmacy even if you're not a member. Drugs can cost much less.\nWatch for plan cost increases. Premiums, deductibles or drug cost tiers can spike. So, look at plans every year, says Epstein. \"There may be lots of changes, such as medications that are no longer covered,\" she says.\nWaiting past age 65 can cost you. You can sign up for Medicare Part D three months before your 65th birthday. But if you wait, you'll be penalized with a 1 percent fee added onto your premium for every month you delayed enrollment. You may owe this penalty if, after your initial enrollment period is over, you go for 63 days or more without Part D coverage or prescription drug coverage that is at least as good as Medicare's. Your initial enrollment period ends three months after you turn 65.\n\"Even if you don't think you'll need Medicare Part D, sign up,\" says Epstein. Cheap plans are better than nothing, and you can always switch during open enrollment."}
{"title": "How to Overcome the Fear of Closing a Sale", "text": "Your palms begin to sweat. You feel your heart begin to speed up its pace. Your stomach begins to churn and words seem to stumble their way out of your mouth. You feel nervous and overly concerned about what words you choose and how you say them. You wonder if your arms are being held in the right position and if you did a good enough job making sure your breath is free of any odors.No, this doesn't describe how many feel while preparing to deliver a public speech or those building up the courage to ask someone out on a date. This describes how many sales professionals feel when they are trying to close a deal.Why All the Drama?Sales is a tough way to earn a living. You put in a lot of work prospecting, qualifying, building rapport, designing a proposal and delivering presentations. At any step in the sales cycle, things can (and sometimes do) go terribly wrong. A prospect, that you were excited about, turns out to have an objection that you can't overcome, or simply cannot afford your product or service. But when things go well through the sales cycle, you arrive at the final step. The Close!And when it's time to close the deal, all your work is put in jeopardy and could all be lost if your prospect says \"no.\"When it comes time to close a deal, a lot is riding on how well you close and what your prospect decides. No wonder so many either hate or avoid closing all together!A Different Point of ViewThe cause of most \"closing\" anxiety is to your point of view or attitude. If you enter a closing conversation, knowing that you have not over-promised and do not run the risk of under-delivering, then you should view the close as a natural part of the business cycle. While you shouldn't fall prey to the attitude of being \"owed a sale,\" you have earned the right to getting the business and should not feel anxious about asking for it.If, however, you took shortcuts during the sales cycle, have potentially made promises that you are not certain you can deliver on, then by all means start feeling nervous!The Close is Not the EndAnother cause of closing-anxiety is the belief that the closing is the final step of the sales cycle. Closing is certainly not the end but should be seen more as the beginning. Once you ask for and earn a sale, you have a customer. One that can be a positive reference for you in the future. One that may become a loyal and repeat customer. Once you've closed a sale, you have created the most important thing to any business: A Customer!Three RejectionsThe funny thing about closing a sale is that it usually takes three attempts before finally getting a \"yes.\" If you ask for a sale and receive a \"no,\" that only means that you either haven't answered all of your prospect's questions or haven't built enough value around your product or service.The problem is that most sales professionals stop after the first \"no.\" You need to keep building value, building rapport and showing your prospect that you and your product will provide the solution to her needs. Stop after one \"no\" and you might as well have not asked for the sale at all.When to Give UpIf you have approached a closing opportunity with a positive attitude, knowing that you have delivered your best and that your proposal is a sound one that makes business sense and your customer simply says \"not interested,\" it may be time to move on.If you asked for the sale a few times and can't get the prospect to become a customer, you may need to regroup, develop a new strategy and take some time away from the prospect. Anxiety is often caused when trying too hard to close a deal or trying too often to close a deal that just can't be closed.While you may be one of the best sales professionals in the world, understanding that no one can close every sale will take an awful lot of pressure off your back. And the more relaxed you are during a sales-close, the better off you and your prospect will be."}
{"title": "Can I Spend My Georgia Food Stamps in North Carolina?", "text": "The federal government oversees the food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). As of December 2010, each state administers its own SNAP program in accordance with federal guidelines; once you receive benefits, you can use them in any state. If you are a Georgia resident, check with your local SNAP office to find out how to apply for benefits in Georgia, even if you intend to use them mainly in North Carolina.\n\nEBT Cards\n\nYou can use the SNAP electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, debit cards that link to your food stamp and cash benefit accounts, in all 50 states. Thus, if you qualify for food stamps in Georgia and are in North Carolina for any reason, you can use your food stamp benefits there as long as you have your EBT card with you.\n\nSNAP Program\n\nTo use food stamp benefits in another state, you must get federal food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Each state administers its own SNAP office, including developing its own SNAP application and application procedures. However, all states have to adhere to federal eligibility guidelines. If you receive state aid but are not eligible for the SNAP program, you will not be able to use those benefits in another state.\n\nEligibility for SNAP\n\nGeorgia residents are eligible for SNAP if their income falls below 130 percent of the federal poverty line. The income limit differs depending upon the number of people in your household and how much of your income you spend on necessary expenses such as rent and utilities. A person who spends time in North Carolina but lives in Georgia must apply for SNAP through a local office in Georgia. The SNAP website has a list of local offices in each state.\n\nIf You Move\n\nIf you move from Georgia to North Carolina, you still will be able to use your EBT card in North Carolina. However, you should contact your SNAP office in Georgia prior to moving to inform it of the move and ask what you need to do. You may need to re-apply once you have proof of your new address, as each state handles SNAP applications and procedures differently."}

While the latest labor statistics show that workers ages 55 to 64 have lower unemployment rates than almost every other age demographic, those who are out of work have a tougher time returning to the job market. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, the median length of unemployment for workers older than 55 increased from 10 weeks in 2007 to 35 weeks in 2011. By comparison, younger workers topped out at 26 weeks of unemployment. Once older workers are out of work, they're more likely to stay there. As of last year, more than one-third of older workers had been out of work for more than one year.\nAccording to the experts, opportunities abound but older workers aren't always up-to-date on how to find them. Here's how you can find a job when you are over 50. Hone in on the hunt It's easy to get lost in online job postings, but landing a position boils down to making the right personal contacts, says Renee Lee Rosenberg, a career coach and author of \"Achieving the Good Life After 50: Tools and Resources for Making It Happen.\" \"If you're sending your resume in online to a job board to a listing that's been posted, you're competing against thousands of other people,\" she says. Instead of being just another resume in the pile, job hunters need to research professionals in their industry, gain a better understanding of what skills and experience companies in the field need and make personal contacts with industry decision-makers, says Rosenberg. A great way to do that is by setting up professional profiles through social networking sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, she adds. According to a recent survey by CareerBuilder.com, 37 percent of companies use social networking sites to research job candidates. \"(Applying online) is not how most people get jobs,\" says Marci Alboher, vice president of Encore.org, a nonprofit think tank based in San Francisco that focuses on helping older workers transition into socially meaningful careers. \"Most people find work ... through their personal connections and through working their networks, and that's true at any age.\" Even when applying online, Alboher adds that it helps to have a personal connection put in a good word. Use age as an advantage Once you've discovered who's hiring, the next step is to create a resume that showcases strengths you can bring to the company, says David Mezzapelle, founder of JobsOver50.com, a job-search site for older workers.\nListen to audio Show Transcript Hide Transcript\nThe job market is rough for everyone, but it can be especially brutal to find a job when you're over 50. Right now workers between ages 55 and 64 have lower unemployment rates than almost every other age demographic, but those who are out of work tend to remain unemployed longer -- for 35 weeks, up from 10 weeks in 2007. So what can you do? Landing a position boils down to making the right personal contacts. Don't send your resume to a listing that's been posted online, where you're competing against thousands of other job seekers. Instead, experts say job hunters need to research professionals in their industry, gain a better understanding of what skills and experience companies in the field need and make personal contacts with industry decision makers. Start by setting up professional profiles through social networking sites like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, and create a resume that showcases the strengths you can bring to a company. For more on this and other personal finance information, visit Bankrate.com.\n\"The biggest costs for these employers, in most cases, are the training and retention of employees,\" he says. \"One of the most attractive things is the loyalty of the 50-plus sector. They tend to stay on jobs longer.\" In addition to highlighting company loyalty, Mezzapelle says older workers should also let future bosses know if they're open to flexible scheduling or starting out in a part-time position before moving to full time. Another major trump card older employees hold over younger ones is experience. To emphasize job-related accomplishments, Rosenberg suggests that older job seekers add a summary statement at the top of their resume that highlights skills, credentials and milestones that the job seeker can bring to the new position."}
{"title": "Asking Experts: When Will The Fed Raise Interest Rates?", "text": "investing\nAsking financial market pros: When will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates?\nThe nation's central bankers say they want to raise interest rates soon, but they keep waiting and waiting. No rate hike came out of the most recent monetary policy meeting; Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen said the time wasn't right because of \"heightened uncertainties abroad.\" As part of our 4th-quarter 2015 Bankrate Market Mavens survey of leading financial market analysts, we asked: When do you expect the Fed will raise interest rates? \"March 2016 or later. The Fed made it clear that they want to see inflation of 2% or better, and it will take at least another 6 months for them to hit the target.\" -- Barry Armstrong, president, Armstrong Advisory Group \"January 2016. I thought it was going to happen in September, so now it will be December, or January 2016.\" -- Cary Carbonaro, author, \"The Money Queen's Guide for Women Who Want to Build Wealth and Banish Fear\" \"October 2015.\" -- Chuck Carlson, CEO, Horizon Investment Services \"January 2016. The Fed has boxed itself in and wants more than ever to leave 0% interest rates behind them.\" -- Marilyn Cohen, president, Envision Capital Management \"January 2016. It's really a guess.

I fully expect the Fed to hike rates this year and would not rule out October, although December is slightly more likely. The Fed should have acted this past week. Interest rates no longer belong at historically low levels to combat extraordinary economic conditions.\" -- Charles Lieberman, managing partner and chief investment officer, Advisors Capital Management \"October 2015. The Fed (members) have backed themselves into a corner with respect to a 2015 rate hike, which is widely expected. Should they delay until 2016, more negative effects are likely as investors wonder just what the Fed is so worried about. An increase in December would be much more difficult than October, with all of the end-of-the-year events affecting markets, so I believe October is most likely. Should we have a government shutdown, however, or if one looks likely, I would expect them to delay to December or even to 2016.\" -- W. Bradford McMillan, chief investment officer, Commonwealth Financial Network \"December 2015. If the latest round of volatility hadn't occurred, we think the Fed would have raised rates at the September meeting. Now that it has tied the decision not to raise rates to concerns about the global economy and financial developments, it will need a multi-month slate of data before it can be reasonably confident again that it can raise rates. With the Fed chair emphasizing that most participants expect a rate hike before the end of the year, we suspect the Fed will raise in December, provided the economic data point to some stabilization -- which is to say it doesn't have to show things getting much better, only that they aren't getting any worse.\" -- Patrick J.

Though not as well-paid as head coaches, NHL assistant coaches can earn six-figure salaries and are frequently promoted to head coaching opportunities.\n\nThe Basics\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics lists the average salary of coaches at $28,340 annually as of 2008. The highest 10 percent earn more than $62,660, according to the Bureau. Coaches in the NHL earn significantly higher salaries. The average salary for NHL coaches is $1 million, according to a September 2009 article by Yahoo Sports.\n\nA Closer Look\n\nNHL assistant coaches typically earn less than six-figure salaries annually. A February 2006 article in the New York Times chronicling the betting scandal of Rick Tocchet, an assistant coach for the Phoenix Cayotes, reports Tocchet's salary at $89,000 annually. Tocchet's salary was well below the average salary for an NHL assistant coach, which is between $150,000 and $200,000 annually, according to an April 2011 article for the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nLoss of Work\n\nThe salary of an NHL assistant coach is greatly impacted by a team's decision to hire or fire a head coach. Because a number of head coaches have the ability to hire their own staff members, their termination often means the same for their assistant coaches. In April of 2011, the Ottawa Senators fired head coach Cory Clouston and his assistants, following a season in which the team failed to make the playoffs.\n\nSalary Increases\n\nThe most common way for NHL assistant coaches to receive salary increases is by becoming head coaches. Examples of this case are Paul Maclean and Claude Noel, former assistant coaches for the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets, respectively. Maclean will coach the Ottawa Senators and Noel will coach new a new franchise in Winnipeg (name not established as of July 2011). Overall, the opportunity for assistant coaches to become head coaches is tough -- due to economic considerations and the need for some teams to hire less experienced coaches at cheaper prices."}
{"title": "Cheap, fast refund loan alternatives", "text": "Just discovered you'll be getting a tax refund? Don't let your enthusiasm to spend that unexpected money get the better of you. Thanks to today's technology, there's really no need to pay extra for a refund anticipation loan, or RAL, just to get your hands on your tax money a tiny bit sooner. If instant cash is more a desire than a need when considering a quick refund, consider these alternatives: Go electronic. Abandon the traditional paper return sent via the U.S. mail and file from your computer. Last year, more than 73 million taxpayers filed their returns electronically. You'll get the money almost as fast as you would with a refund anticipation loan and get it without paying any loan fees or interest.\nIn fact, you may not need to pay for anything. An Internal Revenue Service partnership with tax preparers and software companies offers free online tax preparation and e-filing to some taxpayers. The IRS says that whereas paper filers could wait up to eight weeks for their refunds, most electronic filers can expect their tax checks to show up in their mailboxes in half that time or less. The agency also points out that the error rate is less than 1 percent for electronic filers.\nDirect deposit. Electronic filers who opt for refund direct deposit do even better. More than 61 million people got their refunds this way last year, an 8 percent increase from the year before. The IRS says the money generally shows up in taxpayer bank accounts in 10 to 14 days. Even if you file the old-fashioned paper way, having your refund deposited directly into a bank account cuts the time you have to wait for your tax cash. Plus, it's added protection against lost or stolen refund checks sent via the mail.\nUse store financing. If you want your refund to finance a must-have new appliance, store interest rates usually will be better. Many stores offer free financing for limited time periods. By then, the refund should have arrived and you can use it to pay off the store credit -- and pay no interest at all. Impatience usually wins\nBut ultimately, a refund anticipation loan is a personal preference, not a fiscal issue for taxpayers. Watch: \"Refund anticipation loans\" \"Theoretically, with electronic filing and quicker turnaround on refunds, the need for tax anticipation loans has become obsolete,\" says John L. Stancil, an associate professor of accounting and tax at Florida Southern College in Lakeland. \"However, my observation is that they appear to actually be on the increase, as people become more and more impatient to get their refund. \"One sample I saw from a major company who provides these loans through tax preparers disclosed an annual percentage rate of 264 percent on the loan,\" he says. \"All year long, taxpayers have made the government an interest-free loan, and now they are paying 264 percent to get their own money back a few days quicker.\" Companies that offer refund loans, such as such as H&R Block, are well aware of such impatience, and that's why the loans survive even as electronic filing increases. The tax-preparation giant notes on its Web site, \"Taxpayers choose refund anticipation loans because they can receive money in one to two days, compared to waiting up to 15 days for a tax refund to be directly deposited into their existing bank account or three to eight weeks for a mailed IRS refund check.\" That pitch definitely appeals to those who value speed over cost, such as a person who stands impatiently in front of the microwave wondering when dinner will be done. Recently, larger tax-preparation companies have been offering these impatient customers RALs on an easy-to-use prepaid debit card. The ease of a debit card coupled with the draw of an \"instant refund\" tempt customers looking for a speedy return. With all the pluses of these promises, many customers fail to see all the charges incurred for their impatience. These charges include tax preparer fees, account fees and finance charges, as well as the fees of the card itself, which include charges for ATM withdrawals, balance inquiries and denials to speaking with a live customer service representative. It's a double-whammy for many expecting to see every cent of what their return, only a few days sooner. But if you can squelch your refund appetite for just a few days, then you -- and your bank account -- will be better off."}
{"title": "How to Avoid Collection of a Judgment", "text": "It's much easier for a creditor to collect an unpaid debt once he wins a judgment against you. With a judgment, a creditor can put a lien on your house, garnish your wages or garnish you bank account. Even so, you might still be able to protect your assets.\n\n\n\nAsk to Set Aside\n\nA creditor can win by default if the debtor doesn't show up for the court hearing. If that's your situation, you can ask the court to set the judgment aside. To do this, you must give the court a valid reason for being a no-show, such as the creditor failing to notify you. You also need to show that if you'd actually presented a case the creditor might not have won the judgment.\n\nEach state has its own rules for how to request setting a judgment aside. The website for the court that issued the judgment may be able to provide you with the right forms and legal procedures. If the judge agrees to set aside the judgment, that doesn't make the debt go away. However, you'll have a chance to defend yourself against the creditor in court and prove that issuing a judgment was the wrong decision.\n\n\n\nClaim Exemptions\n\nState and federal law limit a creditor's power to collect, even after she wins a judgment. For example, a creditor can't usually seize Social Security payments, child support or veteran's benefits to pay off your debts. In Washington state, a creditor has to leave at least $500 in your bank account if she garnishes it. If you want to claim an exemption to the judgment, file papers with the court identifying your exempt property. For example, if you live entirely on Social Security, your creditor can't collect. Like a set-aside motion, the exact paperwork varies state to state.\n\nNegotiate a Deal\n\nEven after your creditor wins a judgment, she might still be willing to settle for partial payments. Collecting with a judgment takes time and costs money. If you make an upfront offer to provide a lump sum payment, a creditor might decide to accept the low-hanging fruit rather than make the effort to collect all of it.\n\n\n\nFile Bankruptcy\n\nBankruptcy is a drastic step that will hurt your credit and impact your finances, probably for years. However, the Skiba Law Group says on its website that if the court judgment is just the tip of your debt iceberg, it might be worth considering. Bankruptcy triggers an automatic stay that prevents most creditors from collecting on debt until you emerge from bankruptcy. If you can discharge the debt in bankruptcy \u2014 wipe it out \u2014 the debt legally vanishes and your creditor can never collect."}
{"title": "Can a Person's Name Be on the Title of a Vehicle If Their Name Is Not on the Loan?", "text": "When an individual finances the purchase of a car, the title to the vehicle is sent to the finance company in most states and remains with the company until the vehicle is sold or the loan is paid in full. You may wonder, though, whose name is on the title and whether you can add or remove a name from the car title. Certain rules determine whether an individual's name can be on a car title, and one key factor involves the names listed on the loan.\n\nCar titles determine ownership.\n\nBuyer's Role\n\nThe loan signer designates who will own the car upon full payment of the auto loan. The buyer determines ownership based on whose name he lists on the title. In most instances, the loan signer is buying the vehicle for his own use and lists only his own name. In some cases, though, a buyer intends to designate another individual as the owner or co-owner of the vehicle. The loan signer reserves the right to name anyone as the owner of the vehicle, but that individual must sign the title, too. The actual title, though, remains in the possession of the lienholder, or finance company, until the loan is paid in full. Only after full payment does the lienholder release the lien, and the title then goes to the person listed on the title.\n\nCo-signers\n\nA co-signer signs a loan when the primary signer lacks the credit history to obtain an auto loan on his own. The co-signer gains rights under this agreement, and that includes the right to refuse to sign a loan unless he reaches an agreement with the primary signer as to whose name appears on the title. The co-signer may request that his name appear on the title in addition to the buyer's name or a third party's name.\n\nTitle Changes\n\nOnce the title has been established and the lender takes possession of the auto title, the title cannot be changed until the loan is paid in full or the lender decides to sign over the title for another reason. A name cannot be removed from the title and a name cannot be added to the title. An individual can refinance the vehicle and purchase it from the other title holder. This process takes place in some divorce settlements. When this happens, the title can be changed to reflect the new owner of the vehicle.\n\nRegistration\n\nThe person listed on the registration for a vehicle typically is the same person listed on the title. In some cases, though, the vehicle is registered to the person who normally drives the vehicle and takes responsibility for it. This might not be the person listed on the title. If a person buys a vehicle and registers it, that person is liable in the event of a collision even if the person's name does not appear on the title. Therefore, it is best for the buyer to allow the titled owner to register the vehicle."}

{"title": "Can You Have More Than 1 Roth IRA?", "text": "There's no legal limit to the number of traditional or Roth individual retirement accounts you can open. There is usually a practical limit, however. You can only donate so much to your IRAs each year: Opening 100 Roth accounts doesn't let you save more money than if you had just one.\n\nMaximum Contributions\n\nAt time of writing the maximum you can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA is $5,500 a year, or $6,500 if you're older than 49. That's not per account; it's the total you can contribute to all your IRA accounts combined.\n\nIf your earned compensation for the year is lower than $5,500, you can't contribute more than your compensation. The IRS defines compensation to include:\n\n\u2022Wages, salaries and bonuses\n\n\u2022Commission pay\n\n\u2022Self-employment income\n\n\u2022Alimony and separate maintenance\n\nOther income -- such as rent, dividends, interest and money excluded from taxes -- doesn't count as compensation.\n\nRoth IRAs are subject to an income restriction that doesn't affect traditional IRAs. If your modified adjusted gross income is $183,000 or more, as of 2015, and if you file a joint return, you get a smaller Roth contribution limit. At $193,000 modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, you can't contribute at all.\n\nIf your income is too high to contribute to a Roth, you can still contribute to a traditional IRA and then roll the money over into a Roth account. You pay tax on the rollover, but the withdrawals from the Roth are tax free in retirement.\n\nMultiple Accounts\n\nIRAs aren't free. You have to set your account up with a custodial firm that invests the money and keeps the records. The Financial Web site says fees typically run between $20 and $50, though some firms also charge fees based on the size of the account. Other companies specialize in offering reduced fees to attract customers, and some firms charge substantially higher fees.\n\nIf you place your money in five $1,100 Roth IRAs this year, you have to pay five times the fees you would with one account. The Vanguard Group says having one account reduces the amount of paperwork you have to deal with, as all your investments are in one account."}
{"title": "How much health insurance should you have?", "text": "insurance\nHow much health insurance do you need? The short answer: enough to help you and your family weather an unexpected illness or injury and/or manage chronic health conditions without undue financial hemorrhaging. \"You know you'll likely need something, even if you're a totally healthy person,\" says Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a San Francisco-based insurance consumer advocacy group. \"For most people, it's about comparing deductibles, copays, benefit limits and reimbursement rates -- basically, everything that you could be responsible for -- and then any portion of services that would fall to you, such as hospital stays.\"\nNot much freedom of choice\nUnlike home or auto insurance, there's no way to place a value on the asset being insured -- in this case, your health and the health of your family. And because the worst-case cost of medical remediation can be astronomical, insurers tend to hedge their risk and keep coverage affordable by offering their densely detailed cost-sharing contracts with little or no customization. So, often the question isn't really, \"How much health insurance do I need?\" but, \"What health insurance can I get?\"\n\"Health insurance is offered much more on a take-it-or-leave-it basis,\" says Bach. \"About the only thing you get to choose is how many people you put on your plan.\"\nTypically, the employer-sponsored group plans that cover most Americans cost consumers less than individual insurance policies because the employer pays part or all of the premium.\nThe downside is, employers tend to offer only a limited number of plans, often one each from a health maintenance organization (HMO), a preferred provider organization (PPO) and/or an exclusive provider organization (EPO). Choosing from such a small slate of group plans may sound simple, but there can be challenges.\n\"You don't want to sign up and find that the doctor you really like and have been going to for 10 years isn't in the plan you chose,\" says Dr. Keith Davis of Shoshone, Idaho, named 2014 national Family Physician of the Year by the American Academy of Family Physicians. \"That could steer your decision.\"\nNot 'How much?' but 'Which plan?'\nLike work-based health insurance, individual coverage that you buy directly from insurers on the private market also presents more of a question of \"Which plan?\" than \"How much?\" And, selecting the right individual market plan has not been easy.\n\"You couldn't do an apples-to-apples plan comparison because the plans looked so completely different,\" says Bach. \"There was no way to categorize them.\"\nThat challenge eased dramatically late last year with the opening of the state health exchanges, America's first public health insurance marketplace, created by President Barack Obama's landmark Affordable Care Act.\nThe one-stop, online marketplaces provide easy-to-browse summaries of every policy in your state that is exchange-approved to comply with the Affordable Care Act. For ease of shopping, the exchanges organize their plans into four metal categories: from the highest priced/lowest deductible platinum plans on down through gold and silver to the lowest priced/highest deductible bronze plans.\nJen Mishory, deputy director of Young Invincibles, an advocacy group for consumers aged 18 to 34 years old, says the new federal minimum coverage requirements for exchange policies further simplify shopping for coverage.\n\"On the exchanges, you now have the 10 essential health benefits, so you know that you're getting a plan that covers a lot of the services that young people need, such as free annual checkups, access to prescription drugs, and mental health and maternity services,\" she says.\nGet a health insurance quote."}
{"title": "If You Only Invest in US Markets, You&#39;re Taking a Big Risk", "text": "Most investors are strongly biased in favor of their home country, despite well-documented benefits from international diversification. In fact, billionaire investor Warren Buffett is a notorious advocate of buying and holding only a low-cost S&P 500 index fund.The problem is that the so-called \u2018home bias\u2019 exposes investors to a lot of risk in the form of sector concentration. For example, the S&P 500 may generate nearly half of its revenue from outside of the United States, but the tech sector accounts for nearly 21 percent of the portfolio. A downturn in the tech sector could be catastrophic with individual companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounting for more than 3 percent of the portfolio, as of August 2016.In this article, we will take a closer look at home bias and how investors can mitigate the risk through international diversification.Two Kinds of RiskThe S&P 500 index\u2019s performance over the past several decades has been stellar in comparison to the rest of the world. While it\u2019s easy to assume this growth has been evenly dispersed, a quick look behind the cover reveals that the technology sector has dominated the index\u2019s weighting and has been a key driver behind its growth. The S&P 500\u2019s correlation with the tech industry has been 0.78, compared to just 0.33 for the finance industry since 1993.It\u2019s interesting to note that a sector\u2019s stated weight may not be fully indicative of an index\u2019s real exposure levels. For example, the MSCI Canada index is only weighted about 20 percent in energy, but its returns have a very strong correlation with the energy sector. The reason is many non-energy sector companies still rely on energy prices in determining their growth. For instance, Canadian banks may rely on loans to energy companies to drive their growth rates.Many countries are overexposed to a specific sector or tend to correlate with a sector, since economic theory necessitates specialties. International investors should be aware of these dynamics when constructing their portfolios \u2014 especially when analyzing the level of diversification in their home country. High levels of exposure to a specific sector means that a downturn in that sector could adversely impact the entire portfolio.Ensuring DiversificationInternational investors can ensure their portfolio is properly diversified by looking at a combination of sector weights and correlations. While it\u2019s not always appropriate to maintain equal weightings for sectors, investors should at least be aware if their portfolio is overly exposed to or correlates too closely to specific sectors. If this is the case, a downturn in these sectors could produce an unexpected downturn in the entire portfolio.The first step is taking a look at how much weight each sector holds in a portfolio. For those with a portfolio of individual stocks, Morningstar\u2019s free Instant X-Ray tool is a quick way to determine sector weights in the context of international weightings. Those with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may have to look at each fund\u2019s prospectus to determine sector weightings and then weight those values by the ETF\u2019s percentage of the overall portfolio.The second step is looking at a portfolio\u2019s correlation with various sectors. For those looking for an online tool, InvestSpy can quickly calculate correlations for entire portfolios. Those looking for a more comprehensive solution may be better off using Microsoft Excel to compare their portfolio returns with those of various sector returns and calculate correlations. Statistical applications like R or Python may also be helpful in running these analyses.The Bottom LineInternational investors should keep in mind that investing in other countries doesn\u2019t diversify away all types of risk. When it comes to sector concentration risk, investors should take a close look at their portfolio\u2019s exposure to each sector. It\u2019s equally important to look at the correlation with each sector since weightings don\u2019t take into account an economy-wide reliance on a single sector \u2014 such as energy, technology, or commodities."}

However, you may run into trouble or have doubts about deposit ATMs. Are they safe? Do they have special rules? Learn about a few pitfalls of ATM deposits so you can avoid unpleasant surprises.How to do it: How to Make ATM Deposits Are ATMs Safe for Deposits?For the most part, yes. Your deposits should show up without error. However, you should consider the consequences of an error. If you\u2019re making a large deposit or if you\u2019re in danger of bouncing checks, the ATM might not be your best choice. From time to time there will be errors -- you might not experience them in your lifetime, and most problems will be resolved easily by your bank, but you're dealing with a machine that may make a mistake.You can find plenty of horror stories about deposits that went horribly: money vanishes immediately after going in the slot, there\u2019s no record of the deposit, and so on. If your deposit is a big deal, go inside and work with a teller.You should also observe the basics of ATM security:Location matters: Most Dangerous ATM Locations Basic security tips: Before You Use an ATM If there ever is a problem, an investigation can take several days (at least). The ATM operator will need to review the transaction, any security footage, the internal workings of the machine (including any jammed bills), and report back to your bank. In many cases, the ATM operator is a separate organization -- even if the ATM is located in your bank branch, the employees on staff are most likely not able to open up the machine.Your Bank\u2019s Deposit ATMYou\u2019ll generally only be able to make deposits at ATMs owned by your bank. It\u2019s possible that your bank belongs to a \u2018network\u2019 and you can use any ATM in the network, but it\u2019s best to just use your bank\u2019s ATM.If you use a deposit ATM from another bank (within the network) your funds may not show up in your account as quickly. That's fine if you've got sufficient funds in your account, but it can cause overdrafts, fees, and other problems if you don't.Funds Available After Deposits at ATMsYour bank has policies that spell out when funds are available. For deposit ATMs, the rules might be a little different so call your bank for details. You can generally expect to have $200 or so available from a check deposit quickly, with the rest available in several business days.More details: How Bank Holds Work Alternatives to the ATMIf your bank allows it, you might be able to deposit checks using a mobile device or home computer and scanner. This approach would help you avoid most of the pitfalls above, and you don't even have to leave the house. It might even be worth opening an account at an online bank that offers the service just to enjoy the benefit of remote deposit technology. For a more detailed discussion, see ATM Deposits vs. Remote Check Deposit.In some cases, you'll just have to go inside and deposit with a teller. For example, if you're making a deposit of coins, the bank may have special requirements (and ATMs don't have the ability to accept coins)."}
{"title": "5 Quick Ways to Eliminate Job Applicants", "text": "It's an age old debate and employers weigh in on both sides about the usefulness of publicizing a job salary range when posting a job. On the one hand, when the employer may have potential wiggle room for the right candidate, the employer feels that posting a salary excludes potential, qualified applicants.Posting a salary range makes any candidate who accepts a starting salary in the low to middle end of the published pay grade feel underpaid at the start of a new job. The employer wants to maintain the upper hand in any potential salary negotiation.On the other hand, applicants believe that they will disqualify themselves for jobs they may well have accepted, not in good times, perhaps, but certainly during tough economic down times. Applicants also do not want to waste time applying for jobs that they cannot consider because the pay is too low.They do not believe employers will provide more than a 10% increase over what they currently make, so they hate to reveal the details of their current compensation package. Or, in another somewhat scam, advised by career experts forever, they provide information that values their entire compensation package rather than stating their salary.Whatever position you support in the debate, the fact remains. If the candidate fails to provide salary information or salary information that is meaningful to your process for choosing applicants to interview, you can consider the failure a red flag and disregard the resume and application.A resume or application that is emailed from a current employer\u2019s address is a red flag for employers. The applicant is not only thoughtless, clueless, and not very smart; she is probably job searching on her current employer\u2019s time.Resumes mailed in the current employer\u2019s envelopes, printed on the current employer\u2019s stationery, and stamped on an employer\u2019s mailing machine is another red flag.In fact, this practice is so prevalent that at least one government agency now refuses to consider such job applications. More difficult to pinpoint, but troublesome still, are applications, interview follow-up letters, and uploaded resumes and online job applications that appear to have been sent during work hours by employed applicants.If your online job application takes an hour to fill out, a 2:30 p.m. time stamp is another red flag. If they take advantage of their current employer, you know they\u2019ll take advantage of you.Failure to customize a resume and cover letter is a red flag for employers. The cover letter is an especially telling omission. First, applicants who are unqualified for positions, via their qualifications and work experience, tend to spam employers with resumes.They know that taking the time and energy to custom write a cover letter, when they have little chance of obtaining an interview, is a waste of their time.Understand that their resume review is usually a waste of your time, too. When applicants include a cover letter that essentially says, my resume is attached, you know that they have skipped the most important opportunity that they had to capture your attention.Well-qualified applicants write a custom cover letter that draws a direct connection between the skills and experience you seek and the applicant\u2019s qualifications. Anything else is a red flag.The applicant\u2019s objective is a telling sign, too. An objective, according to current thinking, should draw the applicant\u2019s key qualifications and contributions to an employer\u2019s attention.Assess the strength of applicants who still use generic objectives such as: \u201cTo obtain a position that will enable me to use my strong organizational skills, educational background, and ability to work well with people in roles with increasing responsibility and management potential.\u201d Keep in mind that this objective, sent to every employer, is a serious lost opportunity for you to learn the applicant\u2019s strengths.When resumes and cover letters are customized, applicants have the opportunity to tell you that they have researched and understand your company and your business. They exhibit knowledge of your customers and products and know how they can contribute to your organization.A recent candidate told an interview committee that he \u201chadn't had a chance to visit the company\u2019s website but he was certain that his development skills would enhance the company\u2019s product.\u201dThis applicant should never have become a candidate and his interview wasted the employer\u2019s team\u2019s time. His lack of knowledge and research would have been obvious in effective resume review.Sure, in a tight job market applicants will apply for jobs for which they are overqualified. You walk a fine line in selecting such a candidate for your jobs, however. Your organization will benefit from their long term experience and the knowledge they bring to your workplace.But, any new workplace invests employee time and money in training even an experienced person. Employees build relationships, and your workplace is always disrupted when an employee leaves.And, that is the problem with an overqualified candidate. The employee may leave \u2013 and leave quickly - depending on the success of his or her job search. Their lifestyle, expenses, and family budget were developed with the expectation of a higher salary. Depending on your organization\u2019s size and needs, you may not have a higher level position or better-paying job available for quite some time.So, an employee who was overqualified for the position in the first place may be a short term employee. In fact, they may continue their job search after accepting your offered position. This is the downside to employing an overqualified person in your job.Overqualified applicants are flooding company email boxes and filling out online job applications in record numbers. These applicants need a job \u2013 any job \u2013 in this tough job market.Employers need to decide whether the candidate\u2019s likely short term tenure is offset by the value they will bring to your organization. To make this decision, add in the cost of an entire search for another new employee, and the cost of the loss to your workplace.Try to ascertain, during your interview process, whether the candidate is sufficiently attracted by your job, workplace, industry, or company culture to take a job for which he or she is overqualified.If reasons other than immediate employment are on the candidate\u2019s mind, and key in his or her choice of jobs, perhaps you should consider hiring an overqualified employee. Go in with your eyes open, however. Your decision is always a risk.Another red flag for employers is an unusual employment history, and especially the explanation that your prospective employee offers for their unusual history.Just as an employee with an employment gap is encouraged to provide a viable explanation on the resume or in the cover letter, an applicant with an atypical job history is expected to do the same. In my earlier red flags article, I covered employment gaps. These are additional red flags for which an employer needs to watch.Job hopping does not carry the stigma that it did in the days of the corporation man. Employers are no longer as loyal to employees as they were in another era either. Medium performance is not a guarantee of a job and loyalty, and familiarity does not trump contribution. A series of short term positions is still a red flag to examine.In my most memorable experience, we discovered after hiring that an employee had only put half of her recent jobs on her employment application. Their number, as supplied, was a red flag; had we known the additional places of employment, we would never have hired her, no matter how scarce her skills.(The tip-off? She legitimately injured herself on day two on our job \u2013 we had a video that showed the incident. When I told her that I had to report the injury to workers' compensation, she begged me not to file the papers.) I soon discovered that she had filed workers' comp claims at her last seven employers, all employers within the past five years.But, fraudulent applicants aside, other employees with short-term employment at several jobs may have had legitimate bad luck in choosing employers who downsize or go out of business.They may also still be searching for their best career or choice of employment as evidenced by multiple shifts in careers and employment. I respect employees who quickly decide that a company, a job, or an industry may not fit their interests and aspirations.When you consider a senior employee, multiple career and job shifts need an explanation for each. Prospective employers need to comfortably question potential employees about any details in their application materials that raise red flags.Probe and listen carefully to the candidate\u2019s answers. You\u2019ll be happy you did. With increased experience in interviewing, resume review and candidate selection, you\u2019ll develop a sixth sense for when a candidate is telling you the truth. Trust your instincts."}

{"title": "QE2 to stay on course", "text": "The Federal Open Market Committee meets today, with an announcement expected about 2:15 p.m. EST. There certainly won't be a change in interest rates, and don't expect any changes to the Fed's bond purchase program -- dubbed quantitative easing, or QE2 for short.\nThe tone of economic data has been better, but not so good as for the Fed to call an early halt to the program designed to keep long-term interest rates low and entice investors into riskier assets. The unemployment rate fell from 9.8 percent to 9.4 percent since the last Fed meeting, but not because there are a bevy of new jobs to be had. Instead, the unemployment rate fell because people stopped looking for work. And that dynamic has to change notably -- with a shift away from people not being counted because they've given up looking to one where vacant jobs begin gobbling up the unemployed masses -- before the Fed is comfortable reining in either QE2 or entertaining thoughts of higher interest rates.\nIn anticipating the Fed's post-meeting statement, not many changes are in store. While in December the Fed said \"measures of underlying inflation have continued to trend downward,\" that is no longer the case. In fact, there is sufficient worry -- outside the Fed anyway -- about recent acceleration in prices for commodity-based items, such as energy, being driven largely by emerging market growth. Not only could this inflation eventually be imported, but should a spike in oil prices occur, it could threaten the speed of the recovery.\nThis week also brings the first look at fourth quarter gross domestic product, the measure of economic output. GDP is expected to be stronger, in the 3.5 percent neighborhood, after weak growth in the second and third quarters of 2010. With the Fed holding the status quo on both interest rates and QE2, the GDP may be the big release of the week."}
{"title": "United Services Military Apprenticeship Program (USMAP)", "text": "Military experience is an outstanding resume-builder, if you know how to sell it, but everyone\u2019s looking for that extra edge -- something they can back up with certificates and credentials. One option for sailors and Marines (and the Coast Guard) is the United Services Military Apprenticeship Program (USMAP), a partnership between the US Department of Labor (DOL) and the military that lets service members use their on-duty experience to earn journeyman status in a trade.RequirementsDesigned as an on-the-job training tool, USMAP is only for active duty members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard who already have a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) or rating, a high school diploma or GED, and enough time on their enlistment contract to finish an apprenticeship. Because they\u2019re not employed full-time in an MOS, reservists unfortunately cannot participate in USMAP -- although they could still find civilian apprenticeships on their own (more on that later.)Because USMAP is intended to give servicemembers a leg up using their actual military experience, you need to have an MOS/rating (or an official duty assignment outside your MOS) that corresponds to a journeyman trade. (In other words, an infantryman can\u2019t enroll for a construction apprenticeship just because that\u2019s the job he wants after the military -- unless he\u2019s assigned to official and regular duties, outside his MOS, working in construction.)Here\u2019s an example that could work: As a career planner in the Marine Corps, I was also assigned as the command\u2019s local photographer for portraits and public relations shots. With some creative thinking and some off-duty education, I might have got myself an apprenticeship in photography normally only available to combat camera operators. The downside? Since USMAP only allows one apprenticeship at a time, I\u2019d have gambled away my shot at a human resources certificate relevant to my actual MOS.Eligible OccupationsUSMAP\u2019s Self-Service website offers a convenient list of eligible MOS and ratings that\u2019s not only staggering in size, but surprising in some of the fields it covers. For the sake of brevity, here\u2019s my count of the Navy and Marine occupational fields that aren\u2019t covered by USMAP:Musicians (MU/5500) and air traffic controllers (AC/7200) in either branch.In the Navy, there are no USMAP apprenticeships for Interpretive Cryptologic Technicians (CTI) or Navy Divers (ND).In the Marines, Infantry (0300), Training (0900), Tank and Amphibious Assault Vehicles Operators (1800), Linguists (2700), Chemical/Biological/Radioactive/Nuclear Technicians (5700), and Flight Crews (7300) have no journeyman equivalent.A Few SurprisesWhile it seems USMAP excludes all direct-combat jobs like infantry -- for the presumed reason that they have no equivalent civilian trade -- I found a few interesting exceptions:Special Warfare Operators (SO) -- aka Navy Seals -- are actually eligible, at grade E-7 and above, for an apprenticeship as a Master Homeland Security Specialist if they\u2019re officially assigned the Navy Enlisted Classification Code (NEC) for Disaster Preparedness Operations and Training Specialist (9598) or Anti-Terrorism Training Supervisor Instructor (9501).The Marine Corps\u2019 artillery occupational field (0800) actually has a few journeyman equivalents: Cannoneers (0811) can apprentice as government service ordnance artificers, Fire Controllers (0844) as surveyor assistants, and Sensor Support Techs (0847) as weather observers.EducationUSMAP claims that it \u201crequires no off-duty hours,\u201d but you do need to log 144 hours of formal training for every 2,000 hours (about a year) of apprenticeship work. Fortunately, formal military training for your job can knock a lot of that out in the beginning, and even relevant correspondence courses such as those offered by the Marine Corps Institute (which can also boost promotion potential) count toward the requirement.The worst-case scenario is, of course, having to take off-duty courses using tuition assistance or the GI Bill. But a little education never hurt anyone.Other Apprenticeship ProgramsThere\u2019s a conspicuous lack of information out there regarding apprenticeship programs for the Army, although a program has popped up in the past few years to help soldiers in the Army Reserve and National Guard. For more information, see the National Guard\u2019s web site dedicated to the Guard Apprenticeship Program Initiative (GAPI).Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, veterans may also be eligible for payments to support vocational, technical, and on-the-job training. However, these (with the exception of GAPI) are not military-sponsored programs and are not necessarily apprenticeships. To become a journeyman this way, you\u2019d still have to seek out, apply for, and gain acceptance to an apprenticeship program sponsored by a civilian employer that incorporates vocational training approved for GI Bill payments. Unfortunately, working a civilian apprenticeship opens up the possibility of being paid less than minimum wage, not to mention working outside the uniquely supportive environment of the military."}
{"title": "5 Ways for Law Firms&amp;rsquo; Attorneys to Bill Clients Efficiently", "text": "Tracking and billing time to clients is an important and inevitable part of working in a law firm. Partners, associates, paralegals, litigation support staff and other timekeepers bill their time in six, ten, or fifteen-minute increments, depending on firm policy and client directives. If you fail to bill your time, the firm cannot invoice the client and the firm does not get paid. Thus, timekeeping is a function vital to law firm success.As legal fees increase, clients have become more cost-conscious and tech-savvy. Consequently, clients are examining legal bills more closely and employing a variety of database applications to electronically sort and analyze billing data. A growing trend toward e-billing (electronic invoices) has subjected legal invoices to increased scrutiny, negotiation, and dispute.Whether you are new to billing time or a veteran time-keeper, the tips below can help you create prompt, accurate and precise time entries.Craft Detailed Billing DescriptionsDetailed task descriptions are a fundamental component of a well-drafted invoice. It is important that the description of your efforts contain sufficient detail to allow the reviewer to gauge the nature and merit of the task.Striking the right balance between brevity and detail can be tricky. A task description that is too long and wordy increases ambiguity and dilutes comprehension. A description that is too brief makes it difficult to assess the appropriateness of the task performed and the time expended. For example, perfunctory phrases like \u201cfile review;\u201d \u201ctrial prep\u201d and \u201cdocument review\u201d do little to tell the story of what you did and why you engaged in a particular task. Instead of \u201cdocument review,\u201d a better description is \u201cReview of plaintiff's second set of interrogatories.\"Avoid Block BillingBlock billing is the practice of listing a group of tasks in a block summary under a single time entry. For example: \u201cDraft interrogatory requests; telephone conference with Dr. Brown re: expert report; summarize deposition of Mr. Smith; review and revise correspondence to opposing counsel. 7.3 hours.\u201dClients recognize block billing as a strategy to disguise inefficiency. Moreover, many courts do not permit block billing because it hinders effective reimbursement of attorney fees following a judgment. A more effective way of billing is to separately itemize each independent activity and its corresponding time.Record Time PromptlyRecording your time immediately after you complete a task is the best way to ensure accuracy. Attempting to reconstruct a days\u2019 (or week\u2019s or months\u2019) activities after-the-fact is difficult and encourages time \u201cpadding\u201d (inflating actual time spent on a task to fill in gaps of unaccounted-for time).You may find it impractical to enter each task into your timekeeping software the moment you complete it. Therefore, it\u2019s wise to develop a system for recording time that encourages prompt time keeping. Some timekeepers dictate each task immediately after they\u2019ve performed it and have it transcribed at the end of the day. Others find it easier to keep a time notebook, recording each task by hand and then entering it (or having a secretary enter it) at the end of the day, week or billing period.Remember Your AudienceLike any document you prepare for another\u2019s review, it is important to keep your audience in mind when recording time entries. You many know the individual reviewing your bills \u2013 perhaps the in-house counsel assigned to the file. Understand, however, that the review may not end there. In many cases, an invoice is processed by a number of individuals at various levels inside and outside the company including legal professionals, accountants with the client corporation and third -party auditors. In recording your time, it is best to avoid abbreviations, slang, and complex jargon. Use concise legal terminology but bear in mind that your timesheets may be reviewed by individuals who are not trained in the law.Familiarize Yourself With Client Billing PoliciesEvery client has its own billing policies and procedures. These policies are often contained in the client\u2019s retention or engagement letter. These billing policies may set forth staffing limitations, budgetary guidelines, disbursement policies and specific timekeeping guidelines. By becoming cognizant of the ground rules at the outset, you can more responsibly account for your time and meet client expectations.Corporate clients are making increased use of task-based billing. Task-based billing tracks a firm\u2019s billing by litigation task. Each substantive activity is assigned a computer code that is pre-selected by the client. The coded invoice is then electronically sorted and analyzed, allowing an in-depth analysis of an invoice. Part of familiarizing yourself with client billing policies is learning and properly applying the myriad of specialized task-based billing codes unique to each client."}

{"title": "All About Restaurant Management", "text": "Chances are, if you are thinking of opening a new restaurant or already own your own restaurant, you like to cook, like to eat out or like to be around people.  And any or all of these traits are great to have in the restaurant industry. But to be an effective restaurant owner, you need to be efficient in many other areas as well.  Often times when small business owners are just starting out, you don\u2019t realize that they are doing more than offering a service they are good at. As the owner, you are in charge of hiring, firing, payroll, inventory, maintenance and whole host of other areas.  Being organized right from the beginning and knowing what you can do and what you should delegate to others will help you be the most effective restaurant owner possible.Start Tracking Your Daily BusinessAs soon as you open for business, start tracking your daily sales. A daily business review report can be generated through a POS (Point of Sale) system or tracked by hand in a notebook or on a calendar. For example, I like the calendar, being old-school and all. I simply jotted down the number of lunches in the upper left hand corner of each day on the calendar and dinner numbers in the lower left hand corner. At the end of the year the monthly calendars went into a three-ring binder for easy reference the next year. Easy-Peasy! I also tracked the weather, which in Maine (where I live) plays a vital part in our local restaurant scene. If there is a weekend snowstorm, it can explain low numbers on a Saturday night, or if there is an usually warm spring day, it can help explain a particularly busy lunch rush. The start of vacation season or ski season signals an uptick and business, therefore we knew to add extra staff to each shift.  Keeping track of our daily business review helped us plan for staffing as well as keep payroll in line. It can also help you purchase the right amount of food and beverages, based on the previous year\u2019s numbers.Know How to Effectively Manage Your Restaurant StaffThe hardest part of owning a restaurant, for me at least, was handling the staff issues that inevitably arose.  I was an inept HR person (and that is being pretty generous).  Creating a staff handbook which outlines your business policies, rules and regulations sounds dull, but it is an important aspect of effectively managing your staff. Having clear expectations as well as consequences for poor performance can help circumvent problems later on.  Read more about effective staff management here. Know What to do Yourself and What to OutsourceIf numbers and excel spreadsheets aren\u2019t your thing, seriously consider hiring a part time bookkeeper to handle your payroll and other financial matters.  Other areas to consider outsourcing include your laundry and commercial kitchen cleaning\u2013 it may be cheaper to hire an outside company than to pay your staff to do it.  Marketing is another area that you may want to delegate to an outside vendor.  There are a lot of programs available to make inexpensive websites and with social media, many restaurants don\u2019t even have a website (but they should). Unless you can carve out the time necessary for maintaining an effective social media campaign and keeping your restaurant up-to-date it is better to hand it off to a professional. As the owner of your restaurant, you are the leader. You set the tone for your staff.  People in all industries love to boss-watch and you are no exception.

{"title": "How to Stay Safe from College Identity Theft", "text": "As new and returning students head off to college, they're usually concerned with such things as where to live, where classes are located on campus, how to stretch a tight budget, financial aid, buying books, and a host of other factors important to their day to day life. What most students aren't concerned about is identity theft. Most students think this is an issue which won't affect them; after all, students don\u2019t usually have much money or credit, so they think, \"Why would anyone want to steal my identity?\"The truth is that identity theft is not just about stealing someone\u2019s money or assets \u2013 it's about stealing their name and reputation. Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in the United States, costing Americans over $50 billion in fraudulent charges and affecting some 8 million people annually. Unfortunately, college students are a prime target due to lax habits and a rather surprising indifference.What is Identity Theft and How Does It Occur?Identity theft is the act of someone else taking information which personally identities someone else - a social security number, driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, etc. The thief then uses this information to establish credit accounts, loans, apply for jobs, or commit other fraudulent acts in the victim\u2019s name, or to use the victim\u2019s currently established accounts to buy merchandise or services. Unfortunately, the person responsible for these charges is the victim himself, and it can often take years to clear up the resulting problems.The consequences of identity theft are dire. In most cases, the victim is left with a large amount of debt and may be denied a job, loans for a house or car, and have their credit rating damaged irreparably. This is not a good way to start what should be the beginning of a new life after receiving a college education.Why College Students are Particularly VulnerableFor a thief to steal someone\u2019s identity, they must first obtain the necessary information which allows them to \u201cbecome\u201d someone else, at least in the eyes of lending institutions and other financial companies. How easy this task depends on how vigilant a person is about protecting their personal information.More than half of all college students receive multiple pre-approved credit offers monthly. Those mass-mailed forms, usually partially filled out with the recipient\u2019s information such as name, address, and other personal data is fantastic opportunity to steal a person\u2019s identity.If the recipient is not interested in the offer and simply throws away the form, it is one of the most common documents used by identity thieves. By picking the offer out of the trash can, the thief can then fill in the rest of the blanks and send it in or simply call the toll free phone number provided on the form, allowing them near instant access to one aspect of the victim's identity.Another manner in which identity theft occurs is when thieves get their hands on personal banking account information, such as a checking or savings account statement. Anyone who does not balance their account is at risk of incurring fraudulent charges, simply because they do not keep track of what charges are legitimate. Often, the thief steals by withdrawing money in small increments \u2013 not enough to stand out as a glaring error to the casual observer but enough to build up to a large amount over time.Another danger to college students is their Social Security Number. Many college courses require a student to use their Social Security Number to log in to websites used to post homework assignments and other course communications. The university may also use that number as an identifying number in the administration office.It is very easy to forget to exercise caution when using a Social Security Number, particularly when it is used so often. Lax computer security or even something as simple as a criminal watching a student enter the number allows a thief can quickly and easily gain access to the Social Security Number, which is the key to obtaining additional information about an individual.Computers and laptops also pose a threat that many students don't think about. Many students use a laptop every day in class to take notes and organize coursework documents. But what if that computer is stolen? What would a thief find inside?Most students in today\u2019s world use their computers to access online banking, pay bills, order merchandise, and communicate in just about every other aspect of their lives, too. If personal and account information is stored on the hard drive, the thief has instant access to very information that makes it possible for them to assume the student's identity.Of course, students also shouldn't overlook one of the most common ways to steal someone\u2019s identity - stealing a wallet, purse, or backpack. This can even occur in the student's dorm room, particularly if parties or unfamiliar guests are common, and they usually are in college dorms. Students should exercise the same security at home as in any unfamiliar environment.How to Stay Safe from Identity TheftThe best way to deal with the prospect of identity theft is to avoid it by employing safe practices in everyday life. Here are some tips and best practices to prevent identity theft:Shred all important documents, such as bank statements, credit card offers, and any pieces of paper which contain an account number or social security number. Remember prescription drug containers, too, as they usually have an account number and other personal information printed on the label.Don\u2019t let mail pile up and lay around where anyone could gain access to it. Be sure that anything which goes in the trash bin does not contain any usable information \u2013 shred or tear documents into small pieces if necessary.Always log out of secure sites, such as online banking, before exiting the program. Also ensure your web browser does not save log in and password information associated with sensitive sites.Never store personal information or username and password combinations on your computer\u2019s hard drive. If you must write them down somewhere, make sure the document is stored in a safe location, such as lock box. But it's best to memorize them no written record that could be compromised.Use secure passwords which are not composed of obvious numbers such as date of birth, phone numbers, anniversaries, or addresses. Using a long string of numbers and letters in a random combination is best to avoid hacking.Ensure that the web sites you use for buying merchandise or services are secure. Oftentimes, the URL will be preceded by https:// and it will bear the logo indicating a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.Be wary of emails which are \u201cphishing\u201d for information, or trying to get you to respond to what looks like a legitimate site but redirects you to a thief\u2019s site where your personal information will be recorded. Learn how to spot these phishing emails.Be very careful in giving out your social security number. There are few instances when it is the only number you can use to access or open an account (even at the university). Use a driver\u2019s license to prove identity and do not carry your social security card with you; instead keep in a safe place. The same applies to a student ID card, particularly if it contains your social security number.What to Do If You Suspect You Have Become a Victim of Identity TheftNot just an inconvenience or a detriment to your credit rating, identity theft is classified as a federal crime. According to the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, it is a federal crime if someone \"knowingly transfers or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of the Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law.\"If you suspect that you're identity has been compromised, the first step is to notify all your financial institutions that may have been affected. Ensure that all accounts are closed immediately and ask that any new accounts be flagged for possible fraudulent charges in the future.Next, notify your local law enforcement office of the crime. They will be able to advise you of further steps as well as begin an investigation.Also contact the three credit reporting bureaus and notify them of the theft of your identity. They can put a fraud alert in your file with a date so that charges occurring after this date will not negatively affect your credit rating.The time spent going to college is, for most students, one of the best and most memorable periods in their life. Make sure it is not memorable, however, because of the trauma and suffering which result from the theft of your identity. Be vigilant about protecting your information and never assume that such a crime cannot happen to you. Chances are, there is already someone you know who has had it happen to them."}
{"title": "Does Your Canadian Business Need to Charge the GST/HST?", "text": "Basically, if you sell goods and services in Canada, you must charge customers the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) unless your business qualifies as an exception.The GST is a federal tax, currently 5%.Depending on Your Province of Business, You May Need to Charge Either GST, HST, or GST+PSTIn the provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI and Newfoundland and Labrador you must charge HST because these provinces have combined the GST with their Provincial Sales Taxes to create a Harmonized Sales Tax.Other provinces, such as BC, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, have kept their Provincial Sales Taxes (PST) separate from the federal GST tax system, so in those provinces, your business must charge, collect and remit both GST and PST (and fill out two sets of forms to do so.Still, other provinces and territories, such as Alberta, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, have no Provincial Sales Taxes; in those provinces, your business only has to charge, collect and remit GST.  Here are the PST, GST and HST Rates for All the Different Provinces and Territories in Canada.)Some Businesses Don't Have to Charge the GST/HSTIf your Canadian business fits one of the exceptions, it won't have to charge, collect and remit GST/HST.The two possible exceptions are: selling goods or services that are classed as GST zero-rated or exemptbeing a small supplier 1) If you are selling goods or services that are zero-rated (such as exports, medical devices or basic groceries) or goods or services that are exempt (such as music lessons or child care), you don't have to charge GST/HST.2) Being classed as a small supplier depends on how much money your small business makes in a year. Your business will qualify as a small supplier if \"your total taxable revenues before expenses from all your businesses are $30,000 or less in the last four consecutive calendar quarters and in any single calendar quarter\" (Canada Revenue Agency).If exception #1 doesn't apply and you make over $30,000 you have to register for and charge GST/HST.Note that there are exceptions to the exceptions, too. For instance, taxi and limousine operators and non-resident performers have to charge GST/HST even if they are small suppliers.You may want to register for the GST/HST even if you don't have to because of potential tax benefits.GST/HST RegistrationBefore you can charge the GST/HST, you'll need to register to collect and remit it through the Canada Revenue Agency. They make registration easy for Canadian businesses; you can register by phone (call the Canada Revenue Agency at 1-800-959-5525), online, by mail or even in person at a tax office.(Note that if your business is in Quebec, you need to contact Revenu Quebec instead at 1-800-567-4692 as they deal with GST/HST in that province.)If your small business starts out as a small supplier and you make more than the small supplier limit ($30,000) you'll want to register for GST/HST right away;  in the eyes of the Canada Revenue Agency, you are now a GST registrant and you:have to collect GST/HST on the supply that made your revenue go over $30,000;have to register within 29 days of the day that you made the supply that made your revenue go over $30,000.It's the first point that often trips up small businesses who don't realize they've gone over the limit until some time later when they're doing the books and then discover they didn't charge the GST/HST when they should have. If your small business is classed as a small supplier, you'll want to watch your revenue carefully.When you register, your business will be assigned a business number; this is the number that you and the Canada Revenue Agency will use to identify your business.

{"title": "It&#39;s Nice Work If You Can Get It (and You Can Get it if You Try)", "text": "Session musicians are essentially \"for hire\" musicians. They perform with solo artists and bands, but they are not officially part of the group. Session musicians play on recordings, play in live shows or both. Although some give and take often happens during a recording, the general understanding is that session musicians play what they are asked to play, even when they may have musical reservations about the direction. Affability in these circumstances is key.In general, session players don't write the music. They either play what others have written--the common practice in film session work--or else they improvise a performance, often with not even a chord chart to guide them. For pop, rap and soul session players\u200b, that's an essential part of the job. Sometimes the artist or producer will provide (and insist on your following) a direction. At other times, the producer and/or artist want you to come up with something on your own. Still, you have to do this with some sensitivity to the existing or intended musical direction.Where Do Session Musicians Work?Occasionally, session musicians are tied to studios and may work in a particular location -- this is more common in some geographic regions than others. Most are independent contractors who find work by word of mouth - occasionally from a favorable comment by a studio engineer or, more often, from comments by producers to other producers and artists; artists may also recommend session musicians they have worked with to friends, and so on.Session musicians sometimes go out on tour as well.Finding Work as a Session MusicianThere was a time when labels had session musicians on the payroll as a matter of course--notably Motown and Muscle Shoals -- but this is now almost unheard of. In Nashville, a somewhat different practice exists, where the studios don't hire the players, but the players tend to work with other players in specific studios. Getting work in this environment is a little different than in other regions.Most session musicians get work by word of mouth. The best way to keep steady work coming in is to work on your reputation as the go-to player for your instrument in your area and to be consistently reasonable and easy to get along with. Getting local studio engineers on your side and building a relationship with labels and, above all, producers, is essential - low-key self promotion is critical to getting your career as a session musician off the ground.Become a busy session player can be tough for introverts--the session milieu is partly work and partly a meet-and-greet. If an easy relationship with persons you don't know is hard for you, particularly at short notice and when there are several of them at once, you'll need to work on overcoming this. Many have; it's definitely doable.Getting PaidThe way you are paid as a session musician can depend a lot on where you live. If it isn't a union gig, then you need to negotiate a rate for the job when you're offered it - either an hourly rate or a set fee. In general, more session musicians who work in New York, Los Angeles and Nashville are paid over the union scale minimum -- often double or triple scale -- than musicians working elsewhere. Session musicians almost never receive royalty payments. If the gig is a union job, however, the employer must also contribute to the union's pension fund.Concerns for Session MusiciansThings can get a little complicated for a session musician if certain things aren't hashed out up front. Keep these questions in mind before you take a job. While it would be nice to get any wage agreements in writing, that rarely happens. One well-known LA session musician confided to me that in over 40 years of studio work, he'd never seen or even heard of a signed session wage-agreement other than the standard union contract -- which is always filled out by the paying party after the gig, not before. But in some ways, it's a small industry -- every session musician in a given region comes to know which producers' and artists' word can be trusted and whose cannot.Of course, other issues may arise in a session, and you'll need to deal with them directly and professionally. If you make a significant contribution to a song, for instance, and believe you're entitled to a royalty share, make sure that an agreement is made before you leave the session."}
{"title": "How to Remove the Mortgage Insurance Premium From an FHA Loan", "text": "Competitive interest rates, flexible qualifying and a low down-payment requirement of 3.5 percent make Federal Housing Administration loans attractive. FHA mortgage insurance premiums, or MIPs, protect lenders if borrowers default, but they also increase monthly payments. The FHA requires borrowers who financed 90 percent or more of their home's value on or after June 3, 2013 to pay the MIP for the life of the loan. Borrowers who took out their FHA loans before June 3, 2013 can automatically cancel the MIP if the loan meets certain conditions -- namely, a sufficient amount of equity.\n\nA happy family is standing in front of their home.\n\ncredit: monkeybusinessimages/iStock/Getty Images\n\nStep\n\nReview pre-June 3, 2013 closing documents from your FHA purchase or refinance. A 30-year loan must be at least 60 months, or 5 years old, to qualify for MIP cancellation. There's no minimum time-period requirement for 15-year loans.\n\nStep\n\nReview the FHA appraisal report to determine the home's appraised value when you took out the loan. You must meet the FHA's 78 percent loan-to-value requirement to qualify for cancellation; therefore, you must pay your loan balance down to 78 percent of this appraised value.\n\nStep\n\nCall your FHA lender or loan servicing company and say you'd like to cancel the MIP. You don't actually have to request the removal because it's automatic and based on your FHA loan's set amortization schedule. However, mortgage specialist Brad Yzermans recommends calling the lender to make sure it's aware of the upcoming cancellation."}

{"title": "How to Choose the Best Mortgage Refinance Lender", "text": "If you\u2019re like most homeowners, you likely spend more time and effort deciding on where to go for a $30 meal than for a $300,000 mortgage. For most everything you buy \u2014 from smartphones to fajitas \u2014 you probably research reviews, compare prices and check the social media buzz, except when it comes to your biggest financial decision: a mortgage.\nIf you\u2019re looking to refinance your mortgage, it\u2019s probably more important than ever to find the right lender. You\u2019re looking to lower your interest rate, your monthly payment, and maybe even the number of years it will take to pay off your loan. That\u2019s worth a bit of your time. And odds are, the best refinance lender won\u2019t be your current mortgage holder.\nHow to find the best refinance rate\nFailing to shop around for rates can bite you big time. More than three-quarters (77%) of borrowers apply to a single lender, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the CFPB\u2019s research found that shopping a 30-year mortgage among multiple lenders can lead to interest rates varying by more than half of a percent, which could save you thousands of dollars on your mortgage payments in just the first five years of a loan.\nAnd that\u2019s why your current mortgage holder is probably not the best bet for your refinance. Chances are, you didn\u2019t shop around much for that first mortgage. You were probably just happy to get approved and close the loan, right? But now you know it\u2019s important to compare lenders and apply to more than one. If your current lender offers the best loan package, you\u2019ll know for sure this time.\nTo receive an official loan estimate from a lender, you don\u2019t have to hand over a bunch of written documentation. Usually, it\u2019s just a matter of providing a handful of key details: your name and income, Social Security number, property address, an estimate of your home\u2019s value and the amount you wish to refinance. But the more information you provide, the more accurate the estimate you\u2019ll receive.\nMost lenders will charge a fee of somewhere around $20 to pull your credit report. Then each lender will provide you with a standard loan estimate that will detail the terms and costs of its mortgage refinance proposal.\nMore online mortgage refinance options than ever\nAnd it\u2019s easier than ever to shop mortgage rates. With the rapid growth of alternative mortgage lenders, an online search will get you off to a good start. Not only will you find direct lenders such as Quicken Loans, SoFi and Loan Depot, but also mortgage marketplaces such as Lending Tree and Mortgage Hippo.\nFrom there, you can broaden your search to more traditional \u2014 as well as local \u2014 mortgage lenders.\nConsider a credit union for your home refinance\nCredit unions \u2014 nonprofit, member-owned financial institutions \u2014 offer some of the best bargains on the better-than-a-bank block. Credit unions originated a record amount in mortgages in 2015 but still have only a sliver of the total pie \u2014 just 8.5% of all mortgage loans in the U.S. But that\u2019s about double the amount they originated in 2010.\nObjective advice matters\nMortgage lenders themselves are the most common source of home-loan advice, according to recent research by Fannie Mae. Sure, lenders are helpful but \u2014 and we\u2019re risking a huge understatement here \u2014 they may not be the most objective source of information regarding the product they\u2019re selling.\nSo, even though you\u2019ve been through the home loan process at least once, before you jump into a refinance, make sure the time is right, consider all the things you need to do to maximize your refinance savings, and then take the refinance process step by step.\nBy shopping more than one mortgage lender \u2014 say three or more \u2014 you\u2019ll be way ahead of most borrowers. You\u2019re much more likely to get a better interest rate and save money both in the short and long term. And by comparing the loan estimates you receive from each potential lender side by side, the best mortgage refinance package will be much easier to choose."}
{"title": "Taxes on IRA Withdrawals for Seniors", "text": "Both traditional and Roth individual retirement accounts include tax benefits and requirements for senior citizens. IRA rules include age restrictions for making withdrawals and tax consequences when withdrawing funds early. Taxation on traditional IRAs varies, depending on whether you contributed pre-tax or post-tax funds, and Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals. You may also face tax liabilities if you roll over traditional IRA funds to start a Roth IRA, or if you fail to make required minimum withdrawals after reaching a specific age.IRS regulations stipulate that you cannot make a normal withdrawal from any IRA before reaching the age of 59-1/2. Under most circumstances, you face tax consequences for early withdrawals. However, you may qualify for an early withdrawal prior to age 59-1/2 if you are disabled. If an IRA owner dies and names you as the beneficiary, you may also qualify for penalty-free early withdrawals. According to the IRS, you may face excise tax penalties of up to 10 percent if you make an unqualified withdrawal before the minimum allowable age. You can avoid the excise tax penalty if you deposit early withdrawal funds into another IRA within a 60-day period.Tax requirements on traditional IRAs depend on the type of contributions you made to your account. If you chose to deposit only pre-tax funds, you must pay taxes on the entire amount of withdrawals. However, if you made nondeductible contributions to your traditional IRA, funds for which you previously paid taxes, you must only pay taxes on earnings made on your investment. The IRS also requires you to make minimum withdrawals from traditional IRAs when you reach the age of 70-1/2. If you fail to make minimum withdrawals, you may face excise tax requirements of up to 50 percent.If you own a Roth IRA, you cannot take a tax deduction when you make contributions to your account. However, Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals, as long as you meet age requirements and hold the IRA for five years or more before taking out funds. IRS rules for opening Roth IRAs require you to meet income limits and only allow you to deposit specific amounts of money each year.If you roll over funds from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, you typically face tax liability. To roll over funds into a Roth IRA, you must first withdraw funds from your traditional IRA. If your traditional IRA yields earnings on your investment, you must report the earnings as income. However, starting in 2010, the IRS began allowing you up to two years to pay taxes on income received during an IRA conversion. This enables you to divide your earnings equally, so you do not face the entire tax burden in a single year. You can, however, pay taxes on the entire amount of earnings in one year if you choose. Once you pay the conversion taxes, the IRS does not require any further taxes on the rollover funds."}
{"title": "Auto And Home Insurance: Does It Die With Policyholder?", "text": "insurance\nDid Dad's auto and home insurance die with him?\nDear Insurance Adviser,\nRecently, my dad passed away. Home and auto insurance policies are still in his name. Would his home and car still be covered, even though the house is unoccupied and the car isn't being used? The home is still furnished; the vehicle was damaged prior to my dad's death but was never claimed by him because of his sickness and inability to file a claim. Thanks.\n-- Mike Dear Mike,\nYes, the home and auto insurance policies in your dad's name will still cover claims involving his house and car. Review auto insurance rates at Bankrate.com However, I recommend that you take these actions to avoid possible problems later: Notify your dad's insurance agent of his death and see what requirements his auto and home insurance companies have for continuing the policies.\nAlthough his car is not currently being driven, maintain liability coverage on the vehicle in case it needs servicing or is being test-driven by a prospective buyer. If anyone will be using the car on a long-term basis, notify your father's insurance company. Many automobile policies cover only the insured's legal representative (executor), and then just for driving to and from getting the car serviced.\nIf you know the details of how your dad's car got damaged and the approximate date when that happened, get a repair estimate. If the estimate exceeds your dad's deductible, go ahead and file a claim. Although you'd be in violation of one of the policy conditions, requiring prompt reporting of accidents, I'm sure the adjuster will take your father's failing health into account.\nAs for the house, there generally are no exclusions or limitations on homeowners insurance coverage for unoccupied homes. But coverage reductions can be significant if a home is vacant of all furniture. So, be sure to keep enough furniture in the house that would allow someone to live there.\nTo reduce the risk of burglary, vandalism and fire at the home, install a central station monitored alarm.

How:The landlord must return the tenant\u2019s security deposit, less any allowable deductions, along with any interest that has accrued on the deposit. The deposit must be sent via first-class certified mail to the forwarding address that the tenant has provided or must be delivered to the tenant in person. Deductions:If deductions have been made from the deposit, the landlord must provide a written itemized list stating the reasons for the deductions and the amount that has been deducted. Wrongful Withholding:Landlords who fail to return a tenant\u2019s security deposit according to these rules or who wrongfully withhold a tenant\u2019s security deposit could be liable for up to twice the amount wrongfully withheld and any interest that has accrued plus $500 in damages.8. What Happens to the Security Deposit If You Sell Your Property?If you sell your property or the property otherwise changes ownership, within 60 days of this change in ownership, you must do one of two things: Return the security deposit to the tenant plus any accrued interestor  Transfer the security deposit plus any accrued interest to the new owner and notify the tenant in writing of the name and address of the new owner and the amount being transferred. The tenant has 20 days from this notification to contest the amount being transferred if he or she feels it is incorrect.What Is Minnesota's Security Deposit Law?For the original text of the law governing security deposits in the state of Minnesota, please consult, Minnesota Statutes Annotated \u00a7\u00a7 504B.118, 504B.151, 504B.178  and 504B.195 ."}

{"title": "Music Careers: How to Be a Sound Engineer", "text": "Think that sound engineering might be the music industry job for you? Sound engineers get to be there for the all the good times - at the end of a really great show, chances are that the sound crew will be buzzing just as much as the band. But for all the good times, sound engineers also have to carry a lot of responsibility (not to mention putting up with more than a few cranky bands).Many people think of the sound engineer as the person who stands behind the big sound desk (aka mixing desk) at a show and mixes the sound the audience hears (also known as front of house (FOH) sound).Since there are four distinct steps to commercial production of a recording (including recording, editing, mixing, and mastering), there are other types of sound engineers with particular roles and specializations.Here, veteran sound man Simon Kasprowicz, aka Kas to his friends, shares some insight into the job of a sound engineer and tons of good advice for getting started. A consummate professional and top notch sound engineer, you name a type of show or size of the venue, and chances are Kas has worked it and worked it well. His words are definitely worth taking to heart.One-On-One With Simon KasprowiczQ. First things first - what exactly is a sound engineer?A. Sound engineers come in many guises and none of these are mutually exclusive, a good sound engineer will have a balance of most of these skills.I tend to work as a live FOH (front of house) sound engineer; when you go to a concert and see the big desk and racks of gear at the back of the room I'm the guy standing behind it operating it all, mixing the front of house sound (FOH). This is what the audience hears. Every instrument on stage has a microphone pointing at it or is plugged into a DI box (direct injection box), i.e. kick drum, snare drum, hi-hat, bass, guitar, keyboard, violin, vocals. Each one of these corresponds to a channel on the mixing desk, and it is my job to balance the sound, make sure everything is audible and pleasing to the ears, via the use of gain, EQ, compression, effects and so on.There is also monitor sound, which will either be done at the FOH desk or on a separate desk at the side of the stage. This is what the band hears. Each member of the band will have a set of monitors either in the form of wedges on stage or in-ear phones, and the monitor engineer will send individual mixes to each of these as the band requires.This is not always a balanced mix like out front, as the musician may only what to hear key things. The singer may only want his vocals since he can hear the drums and guitars loud enough already. The musicians will instruct the monitor engineer to what they individually require.Then there are the system engineers. These are the guys and girls that set up the PA system, rig all the speakers, set up all the amplifiers and system processing and make sure that everything thing is working as it should be. A good system engineer makes your job as a FOH engineer much easier.Then there is the stage crew who place and cable up all the microphones and do any re-patching that may be required.On some gigs, especially smaller ones, all of the above may be done by one person.Q. What kind of training do you have?A. I started out working weekends in a small jazz club in Edinburgh (Scotland), learning on the job as I went along, then moving on to bigger venues such as King Tuts Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow and festivals, to working for the bands directly touring Europe and the States.Q. What is the pay like for your job? How do you set your prices?A. Pay varies greatly and is totally negotiable depending on the job, hours conditions, etc, but I normally get between $200 and $500 a day.Q. How do you find work?I get work mostly through word of mouth and reputation, with bands contacting me through friends, tour managers and directly, with some regular work at venues and for PA hire companies, doing bands, festivals and corporate events (conferences, award shows etc).Good Engineers Vs. Bad OnesA. What separates a good sound engineer from a bad one? What are some bad habits some sound engineers have that bands should watch out for?This is such a difficult question. Who's the best record producer? George Martin, Phil Spector, Steve Albini, Butch Vig? It's totally subjective and depends upon individual taste. What some will think is fantastic others will find fault in. Bands need to work together with their engineers and find a style that is suitable for them.A good engineer will be able to mix a variety of different styles well. I started in a jazz club, then did a load of folk festivals and worked in clubs doing funk, dance, rock, indie and metal so am well versed in many styles of music and completely adaptable to what the situation requires.The main thing is to have a good attitude, remain calm under stress and keep a smile on your face.Bands and Sound EngineersQ. What can bands do to make life easier for their sound engineer?A. Bands can make the sound engineer\u2019s job a lot easier just by following a few basics, especially when they are starting out. Be organized about how you set up for starters, i e if you have a lot of FX pedals, don't take 20 minutes plugging these up have then pre-set up on a board so it only takes you two seconds, the quicker you can set up the more time you'll have to sound check.Listen to the engineer. In small venues he may ask you to turn down your back line (guitar amps , bass amps etc); he's not being malicious, it could be that they are drowning everything else out. If need be, tilt your amp up towards your head or stick it on crates, you'd be amazed by the number of guitarists who think that their ears are in their knees.If you don't have them already, buy tuning pedals and tune when you are not playing, the number of sets that are ruined because the momentum is lost as the band spends five minutes between songs tuning up.Also, know what you are trying to achieve, in a sense good bands almost mix themselves. By this, I don't mean they have a mixer on stage and ride the faders, but that they've thought about their sound and levels and the songs are well arranged so that everything has a place and sits in the mix.Generally be nice, polite, punctual and friendly to the people you meet at the gig.Q. When you get to a venue, what do you want to see there waiting for you? What do you see that makes you think \"uh-oh?\"A. A nice hot cup of tea.Friendly efficient house engineers and good PA that has been set up correctly and is suitable for the space  with good well maintained equipment.I think uh oh when the gear is clearly falling apart hasn't been looked after and in some cases blatantly not working with an in-house engineer who is passed caring.Q. What's your best advice for someone interested in becoming a sound engineer?A. Ha, get a real job.Na, work hard, try and get a foot in at some local venues, listen to a variety of different music, go to a lot of gigs and chat to the engineers there, and contact the local PA companies and see if you can help out there."}
{"title": "The Basics of the Evaluation Section of Your Grant Proposal", "text": "Why Evaluation Is So ImportantEvery funder, whether a foundation, a corporation or a government agency wants to know if the project they funded worked or not.Consequently, your proposal must include how you will evaluate your project, when you will do it and how you will report your results.  Of course, you expect to succeed, or you wouldn't be proposing your project to a funder.However, just as any experiment reveals much whether it succeeds or not, how well your project succeeds or falls short will give you and your funder valuable information.So set up your goals, decide how you will achieve them, and then evaluate what worked and what didn't. Decide upfront what success will look like so you'll know how close you got to achieving it.How to Do Evaluation RightHere are some tips to help you develop that crucial evaluation section of your grant proposal. Internal Evaluation or External? Decide if you are going to do an internal assessment with your staff, or if you want to hire outside expertise to conduct your evaluation. Foundations often allow nonprofits to designate 5-10 percent of the total project budget for evaluation. Determine Goals. Before you design your evaluation, consider the reasons to do it.  Carlson and O'Neal-McElrath, authors of Winning Grants, Step by Step, suggest that assessments can accomplish these six purposes:To find out if the hypothesis was right. Did your do what you set out to do?To determine if the methods specified were used, and if the objectives were met.To find out if an impact was made on the identified need.To obtain feedback from the people served and other members of the community.To maintain control over the project (evaluations often take place at various points in the project allowing for corrections).To make changes in the program mid-stream, if necessary, to ensure the program's success. Quantitative or Qualitative?Decide if you will use quantitative or qualitative methods for your data collection, or what combination of the two types you will use. Develop a good description of these methods and why you're using them. Integrate the Evaluation.Make sure the evaluation component of your proposal connects with the proposal's objectives and methods. If those objectives and methods are measurable and time-specific, the evaluation will be easier to design. Keep Checking. \u200b\u200bAsk yourself these questions as you develop the evaluation section of your proposal:What is the evaluation's purpose?How will you use the findings?What will you know after the evaluation that you didn't know before?What will you do as a result of the evaluation that you couldn't do before because you lacked the relevant information?How will your clients and community be better as a consequence of the program?Sample of Evaluation Section for a ProposalMeasuring the Success of the Ridge, Kids and Stewards ProgramCurrently, program facilitators administer both a pretest and a posttest to youth participants in order to measure what information is learned by the students during the six-week program. At the conclusion of each session, we also ask participating teachers to complete a detailed evaluation questionnaire so we can continue to find ways to improve an already excellent program.The Ridge, Kids and Stewards (RDK) program is also regularly evaluated by an outside panel of professional evaluators. Because it is our goal to teach young people to become stewards of the environment, the RKS program coordinator and others are working to develop a more sophisticated, yet practical, evaluation process in order to measure the long-term impact of the program on youth who participate.Sample reprinted with permission from Storytelling for Grantseekers, Second Edition, Cheryl A.

{"title": "How to Check My SSI Disability Claim Status", "text": "On average, it takes about three to four months to get a decision on an initial Social Security disability claim or an appeal. However, because the program has no firm deadlines, a decision on an initial claim can come in as little as 30 days or take as long as two years, while an appeal decision can take more than six months. Fortunately, there are ways to check on the status of your claim in person, online or by telephone.\n\nA senior couple look at a laptop screen together.\n\ncredit: Jack Hollingsworth/Photodisc/Getty Images\n\nThe Claims Process\n\nAn initial disability claim passes through more than one office before the Social Security Administration notifies you about its decision. These include an SSA field office and at least one federally funded state agency called a Disability Determination Service. A field officer reviews your application to make sure you meet basic eligibility requirements, then sends your file to a DDS representative, who conducts a field investigation, makes an initial determination, and then sends the file back to the field office for a final decision.\n\nFrequency and Required Information\n\nAccording to Beth Laurence, an attorney and legal editor for Disability Secrets, checking on your claim regularly can ensure that paperwork isn't hung up or lost in the process and it can also speed up your claim. Wait at least five days after filing and then check on your claim. You need to provide your Social Security number or the Social Security number of the person whose claim you're checking on and the confirmation number you received at the time of filing whenever you check on a claim.\n\nGeneral Status Update\n\nCall your local SSA office or use the online status update tool on the SSA website if all you need is a general status update on your claim. The SSA also has an office locator tool on its website to help you find the correct telephone number. Although you can get information about where your claim is in the process with these options, neither one can provide information about when to expect a decision or identify any issues or problems that are causing delays.\n\nGet Status Details\n\nIf you don't get a decision within a few months or just want more information than a general update can provide, call the disability examiner assigned to evaluate your claim. Your state or local SSA office can provide the telephone number for your local DDS office. When you call, provide your Social Security number and say that you want to inquire about the status of your case. The operator will locate and connect you with your examiner, who can tell you whether your case is pending or has been decided on and tell you about potential issues, but cannot tell you whether your claim has been approved or denied. If your claim is pending, Laurence recommends you ask the examiner what you can do to expedite your claim."}

{"title": "Does Income Have to Exceed 401(k) Contributions?", "text": "Your employer-sponsored 401k plan allows you to save money for retirement through payroll withdrawals, making saving automatic. Your contributions are tax-deductible. You pay taxes on the money as you withdraw it from the account upon your retirement. The Internal Revenue Service restricts the amount you can contribute to your 401k. Your income doesn't have to be more than the amount you contribute, but it must at least equal the amount.You can contribute to a 401k if your employer establishes one and you earn wages. Your employer withholds an amount you designate from your paycheck and forwards this amount to the financial institution that manages the 401k. If you don't earn wages, you can't make a contribution. For instance, if you take a sabbatical for a year, you're technically still an employee of the company, but you can't make any new 401k contributions until you begin receiving a paycheck again.The IRS sets a maximum amount you may contribute to a 401k plan each year. For 2010 and 2011 this maximum is $16,500 a year for anyone under 50 years of age. You need to earn at least $16,500 in wages in order to contribute this maximum. If you're more than 50 years old, you can make an additional catch-up contribution of $5,500, as of 2010 and 2011, provided your plan allows for such catch-up contributions. Your wages must equal the amount of regular and catch-up contributions, but don't have to be more than this amount.Your employer can set some rules regarding its 401k plan. For instance, federal law doesn't require your employer to permit catch-up contributions. Your employer may choose to match all or part of your contributions. Your employer may require every employee to contribute a certain percentage of their income to the retirement plan, although you have the option to change that percentage or opt out of making contributions altogether.If you work for more than one employer and are eligible to participate in a 401k or other retirement plan with each employer, all your contributions added together can't exceed the maximum contributions as mandated by the 401k. It's up to you to keep track of your contributions and make certain you don't exceed the maximums. If you determine you've contributed too much, you can request a refund without penalty, as long as you do so prior to April 15 of the following year."}
{"title": "Is a Domino&#39;s Pizza Franchise a Good Investment?", "text": "For decades, the quick-service delivery pizza market was dominated by a few major players. In this new millennium, however, that pizza oligarchy has been challenged by a number of young upstarts looking to capture their own slice of the market. The competition has come from all sides, through menus expanding to include salads and a generally broader variety of options, to brands that have tightened their focus on creating the best pizza pie they can make. The market seemed to be dictating that the consumer either wanted everything, or they wanted the best thing.Of the established brands, Domino\u2019s may have made the most apparent change to adapt to the new market; they literally changed their name, dropping the \u201cPizza\u201d in 2012 to simply be known now as \u201cDomino\u2019s.\u201d The move was accompanied by a large national advertising campaign which claimed that since Domino\u2019s had been offering more than pizza for quite some time, it just made sense to no longer limit themselves in their brand name. While the brand has continued to develop their menu, the vast majority of their offering still revolves around carbs, cheese and tomato sauce, whether that come in the form of a pizza, a sandwich, or a pasta bowl.Domino\u2019s has also begun further emphasizing their take-out business in their advertising and operations. Traditionally, quick-service pizza brands focused almost exclusively on delivery, and Domino\u2019s was no different. In the early 1970s, Domino\u2019s came out with one of the indelible marketing campaigns of the last fifty years with their \u201c30 Minutes or It's Free\u201d guarantee, which has since been endlessly copied, parodied, and ultimately litigated over the past 40 years. However, in recent years, as competitors such as Little Caesar\u2019s have increased their market share, Domino\u2019s has made moves to position themselves as a leading take-out option in the industry.The constant attempts to adapt to a changing marketplace have served Domino\u2019s well, both historically and in recent years. While the \u201c30 Minutes or It\u2019s Free\u201d delivery guarantee ultimately had to be discontinued due to multiple lawsuits claiming the delivery guarantee led to reckless driving by delivery drivers, it ultimately did have the effect of placing Domino\u2019s into that hallowed pizza oligarchy over the last generation.After a slow descent to a stock low point in 2009, Domino\u2019s recent changes have helped it rise back to prominence, with a stock price increase of over 700 percent over the last half decade. Its most recent addition \u2013 the innovative \u201cPizza Car\u201d that can carry 80 pizzas and has a 140-degree oven on board \u2013 has continued the company\u2019s tradition of innovation. Domino\u2019s continues to weather the storms that every established system has to face, and it continues to be proactive in protecting and building on its incredibly valuable brand. Entrepreneur magazine has consistently rated Domino's Pizza \u201cthe best franchise opportunity in the pizza category.\u201dThe Domino's Franchise SystemDomestically, Domino\u2019s has almost 900 independent franchisees. They boast that more than 90% of those franchisees began their careers as hourly employees of Domino\u2019s, rising from the ranks of drivers and pizza makers to being independent small business owners. Overall, 97% of Domino\u2019s locations are franchisee-owned.Internationally, Domino\u2019s operates in 73 countries, with locations in 5,700 cities worldwide. The company is expanding into emerging markets, including opening its first location in Thailand in 2013 and Kenya in 2014. The majority of Domino\u2019s international expansion has been through Master Franchise agreements. In recent years these international rights have been consolidated within three companies, with Australian Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises owning the master franchising rights to not only Australia and New Zealand, but also much of Europe.The master rights to the UK and Ireland market, along with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg, are owned by the British company Domino\u2019s Pizza Group. The rights to India, which is Domino\u2019s largest international market outside of the USA, along with Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks.Domino's Franchise InformationBusiness Established: 1960Initial Investment: $119,950 to $461,700Liquid Cash Requirement: $75,000Franchise Fee: $25,000Royalty Fee: 5.5%Ad Fund: 3%+Pros Special Incentive Programs - VetFran participant with hefty veterans discount, minority and women's programs available.

{"title": "Everything You Need to Know About Chapter 13 Bankruptcy", "text": "When most people think of \"bankruptcy\", chances are they are thinking about Chapter 7 straight bankruptcy, the type that eliminates their obligation to pay most debts. There is another kind of bankruptcy that serves other purposes and can be very useful for people who are behind on car or house payments and need a way to get caught up. This second type of bankruptcy is called Chapter 13 repayment plan bankruptcy. The hallmark of the Chapter 13 case is its repayment plan. Together, in 2015 according to bankruptcy court statistics, 819,240 non-business Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases were filed in the United States. Just over one-third of those were Chapter 13 cases. A Chapter 7 case is arguably the easier, quicker and less expensive as compared to Chapter 13, but a Chapter 7 does not provide any way for the filer to handle those past due payments. In a Chapter 7, it would be up to the filer to work out arrangements on her own. When you're facing foreclosure or repossession, that can be extremely difficult and stressful. In addition, the Chapter 13 repayment plan provides a way for people to get caught up on taxes and domestic support obligations like child support. When you file a bankruptcy case, we call you the \u201cdebtor.\u201d The goal of most debtors in Chapter 13 is to save their important assets and obtain a discharge, which is an order from the court that tells the debtor\u2019s creditors that the debtor has fulfilled all the requirements for filing the Chapter 13 case, and that in exchange, the debtor no longer has any obligation to pay certain debts. (Not all debts are dischargeable, however. See below.)To get to that point, like with any worthwhile endeavor, you will have a lot of work to do before you file your Chapter 13 case.Credit Counseling One of the first steps on the road to financial freedom is a credit counseling session. Before you can file any type of bankruptcy case, you must take part in a special credit counseling session during which a credit counselor will review your budget to determine if you might have available other avenues for gaining control over your finances. These credit counseling sessions are offered by private, government-approved companies, usually last about an hour and usually cost about $25. The session can easily be accomplished online (plus a short telephone check-in with a live counselor), and telephone and face-to-face options are also available. The session can easily be accomplished online (plus a short telephone check-in with a live counselor), and telephone and face-to-face options are also available.Means TestIn 2005, Congress passed some new laws that decided to cut down on abuses of the bankruptcy system by people who should be able to afford to pay back their debts. Thus, the means test was born. The means test is a calculation that compares your income to your reasonable and necessary expenses, also taking into consideration your family size and the median (midpoint) income for your state. The means test tells us whether you could pay your debts in part and would be presumed to be abusing the system if you filed a Chapter 7 case. If you cannot \"pass\" the means test to file a Chapter 7 case, the means test can also calculate how much you should be able to afford to pay back each month (at least according to Congress) to satisfy some of your debts.SchedulesAll bankruptcy cases are filed in special federal bankruptcy courts. To start a Chapter 13 case, you will file documents that list all your income, expenses, debts, and assets. These are called the petition, schedules and statement of financial affairs. The schedules can be 60 pages or more of information. All of the information must be complete, true and correct to the best of your knowledge, and you will sign them under \u201cpenalty of perjury,\u201d similar to swearing an oath in court.Repayment PlanThe Chapter 13 repayment plan will usually last at least three years, but no more than five years. At the beginning of the case, you will propose a plan to pay all the creditors that must be paid (not all creditors have to be paid through Chapter 13). Your debts are classified according to whether they are unsecured (no collateral) or secured (with collateral). The bankruptcy code also assigns a priority to each type of debt. Debts for taxes and child support, for instance, have a higher priority than credit cards. Your monthly payment under the plan depends on many different factors, including the how much you owe in mortgage arrearages, whether you pay your car payment through the plan, how much priority debt you have, your income, and your reasonable and necessary expenses. Often, you will not have to pay back all that you owe. If you have enough income to pay back your priority debt like taxes, but not enough to pay back you credit cards, you may not have to pay those credit cards after all. Judge and TrusteeWhen your case is filed, it is assigned to a bankruptcy judge and to a trustee. Chances are very good that you will go through your entire case without ever appearing in a courtroom before the judge. The trustee is appointed to oversee the case. You will make your plan payments to the trustee, who makes sure the money gets to the right creditors.Meeting of CreditorsAbout a month after your case is filed, you and your attorney will meet with the trustee at what is called a meeting of creditors or a Section 341 meeting. Ironically, creditors rarely attend the meeting of creditors but it does give the trustee a chance to clarify any questions about your assets and your financial picture. In a Chapter 13 case, the trustee will also examine the terms of your payment plan to make sure that the plan is feasible (you can afford the payments) Although the meeting is not held in court, it is conducted under oath.Creditor Claims After the meeting, the creditors have a certain amount of time in which to file a claim with the court. Creditors must file claim forms with the court before they can be paid anything from your Chapter 13 plan. The claim form will state how much the creditor thinks is owed and will offer documentation to support the claim. If the trustee or the debtor disagrees with the claim in any way, either or both can file an objection to the claim. Any objections not resolved by the parties can be taken to the bankruptcy judge for a decision. Confirmation of the PlanWhile the claims are being filed, the trustee will also be looking at the plan to make sure it is workable, or feasible. The trustee will know from the schedules you filed approximately how much the claims are going to be. The trustee also knows your income and your expenses. If it appears that you are just not making enough money to pay the debts that absolutely have to be paid through the plan, the plan is not feasible and the trustee will object to it. Otherwise, as long as you provide for all the claims that have to be paid, and you make enough money to cover them, your plan will likely be confirmed by the court.  Debtor Education RequirementIn addition to the credit counseling you take before the case is filed, you will also have to take a financial management course before your debts can be discharged. This course, which usually lasts about two hours, will be available from the same company that offers the credit counseling session for about $25.Other RequirementsWhile you're making your Chapter 13 plan payments to the trustee, you are also required to keep up other payments, including your house payments, car payments, and child support and alimony payments. You must also file your tax returns each year and make sure that your taxes are timely paid. When Things Go WrongFive years is a long time to be in a Chapter 13 case. Many things can happen to upset the flow of payments. Unemployment, medical issues, divorce, are not uncommon. If you find yourself unable to make Chapter 13 plan payments, house payments or any other payments you are required to make, there may be ways to modify your plan or catch up the payments you missed. It is vital that you contact your attorney immediately when this happens so that you can discuss your alternatives. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to fix issues. Your only alternative at that point may be to dismiss your case, refile and start all over again.Getting Credit During a Chapter 13 CaseIs it possible to get credit during a Chapter 13 case? Yes, it is, but you cannot just apply for a new credit card. You have to ask the bankruptcy court for permission, and the credit has to be for something necessary, like a car to get to work. Many people have refinanced or worked out loan modifications with their mortgage lenders. These are also treated like new debt. You have to file a motion with the court explaining the transaction. You will probably have to testify before the bankruptcy judge to explain why you need to take on this additional obligation and how you will be able to afford the payment. DischargeOnce all your payments have been made under your plan, and the court is satisfied that your domestic support obligations like child support are current, the court will issue the discharge order. What an accomplishment! At that point, your house will be up to date, your car will likely be paid off, and other priority debts have been paid in full. Any remaining unsecured debt will be discharged, with the exception of certain non-dischargeable debts like most student loans."}
{"title": "How Much Do Gas Haulers Make?", "text": "Commercial fuel-truck drivers must obtain more qualifications than most commercial truck drivers. Because their cargo is extremely flammable and poses an environmental hazard as well, fuel haulers are required to get additional training in safe fuel handling and HAZMAT (hazardous materials) training. Their pay generally reflects the additional hazards they endure and training they must possess, compared to other truck drivers.\n\nWages\n\nAccording to May 2010 figures by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, truck drivers employed by petroleum product wholesalers in general earned a median hourly wage of $19.10, or an average of $39,730 per year.\n\nCommercial Truck Drivers\n\nFuel-truck drivers are a subset of large-rig commercial truck drivers - those who drive vehicles with gross vehicle weights, or GSW, of more than 26,000 pounds. The lowest-paid 10 percent of these drivers earned $11.89 per hour or less as of 2010, according to the Department of Labor Statistics, while the highest paid 10 percent of commercial large-rig drivers earned $27.64 per hour or more.\n\nHighest-Paying States\n\nCompensation for fuel truck drivers varies by state. As of 2010, the states with the highest mean hourly wages for commercial fuel truck haulers were Alaska ($23.20), Nevada ($22.34), New Jersey ($21.09), Massachusetts ($21.00), and New York ($20.89). Note thatmost of the highest-paying states are in the northern states with significant snow and ice, which poses a safety concern for truck drivers. Employers must frequently pay a premium wage to compete for truck drivers in markets where roads are frequently dangerously icy for much of the year. Also, some truck drivers in Alaska live and work in very remote, hostile work conditions. These drivers earn a premium wage to compensate them for being apart from families and living in a harsh environment. In Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, for instance, a fuel truck drive can earn more than $100,000 a year, according to Indeed.com.\n\nDuties and Responsibilities\n\nFuel haulers frequently transfer fuel from wholesale storage tanks to their trucks, and from their trucks to retail storage tanks. This can be hazardous, especially if the truck is not grounded properly. which can cause a spark, followed by a fuel fire. Fuel haulers must also assist mechanics in inspecting and maintaining their own rigs, pumps and other equipment."}

The title is displayed by the browser, usually at the top of your computer screen, and tells a reader what page they are on. Meta titles are also read by search engine robots and seen by site visitors so it is important to have a strong title for search engines, but one that still makes sense to your human website visitors.The meta title was once very important for helping the page rank higher in search engine returns and many webmasters wrote them to cater only to search engine robots first without much regard for how it read to website visitors.Meta titles should make sense to the reader, but the wording should also be based on keyword search popularity and relevance to the rest of the web page including other meta data and content.  As you may have guessed, meta titles are important to think about, but should also sound natural to the reader.Common Mistakes to Avoid When Creating Meta TitlesThe biggest mistakes you can make when creating a meta title for your page are:Not creating any page title at allMaking titles too long. Long page titles are truncated and search engines stop reading after a certain number of characters. Limit your title to 55 characters maximum, including spaces and punctuation.Naming your page the same name as your website or business name Naming all your pages the same name, or something similar to each otherNaming the page without connecting it to your content and other meta dataRepeating (spamming) keywords in titles.If you are having trouble figuring out what keywords to focus on, you can use keyword selector tools and keyword density tools to help you write your meta title.Examples of Bad Meta TitlesThe following example meta titles are too vague and do not give search engine robots or you website readers enough information:FlowersPopulation StatisticsChocolate IndulgenceE-Z Tax TipsExamples of Good Meta TitlesEasy Tips on Growing Flowering Shrubs2008 Population Statistics, Number of People In USBest Baked Coca Recipes Chocolate CakeTax Advice - How to Pay Less In TaxesNote that the above title tags accomplish three things:They help robots understand what is most important about the content on the page by repeating part of the keyword phrases that would be found in article titles and content;They make sense to people reading them; andBy using different words meaning the same or similar things without actually repeating them (spam) and using plurals when sensible, it allows for greater possibilities for appearing in searches for the same information but on different terms.How Long Should a Meta Title Be in Length?Generally, a title should be long enough to be clear; short enough to avoid being truncated.  Truncation happens when a title is too long and means that only part of your title will show in search engine results.Search engine robots may also only read a certain number of characters in certain types of meta data and then they ignore the rest and just move on. Different search engines read different numbers of characters but if you keep your titles less than 55 characters you will keep most major search engine robots happy.  Although Google sometimes seems to stop just shy of 55 characters based on their chosen font and how much linear space individual characters take up, aim for 55 characters and you should be fine.Tips on How to Create Powerful Meta TitlesWhen creating meta titles:Do repeat keyword ideas in different words - no more than twice is usually best and keywords should not be identical within the same meta data stringDo tie these phrases to your content and other meta dataDo use plurals and word variations when possibleDo limit the use of punctuationDo use initial caps throughout the titleSummaryCatering to search engines is important - but that only means following their recommended practices and not forgetting about your human site visitors.  When writing meta titles just ask yourself how does it sound when you read it out loud to others - does it make sense? Would they know what you are talking about? If not, then you are thinking too hard about appeasing search engines and not enough about your audience.  In the long run, you are much better off creating human-friendly meta title."}

{"title": "Credit Cards - Compare Best Card Offers & Apply Online", "text": "The \"very first question\" the consumer should ask is, \"Why am I applying for this card? Why do I need this card?\" says Bruce McClary, media director for ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions, a nonprofit affiliated with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling Some positive reasons: The card has low or no fees, a lower interest rate or offers a rewards program that suits your spending habits. \"It has to make sense, and it has to fit into your overall lifestyle,\" McClary says. Do you pay off your credit card balances every month? If so, \"you don't care what the interest rate is because you won't pay any,\" says Ric Edelman, author of \"The Truth About Money.\" \"But you care about the (annual) fee,\" he says. If you run a balance, you want the lowest rate you can get, even if that comes with an annual fee.\nOne clue to your usage: \"Look at your past history,\" says Edelman. \"Because what you've done before is what you will be doing.\"\nIf you're shopping for a card, chances are you're comparing card terms. But if an issuer sends you an offer, it's tempting to apply and see what you get. \"It's really difficult to pick one (in isolation),\" says Kelly Rogers, chief development officer for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Orange County and adjunct faculty at Chapman University. \"If someone just shows you one car, how do you know if it's the right car for you?\" Her advice: Do a side-by-side comparison of several different cards before you apply. Don't be afraid to plug the card name, \"complaints\" and \"customer service\" into your favorite search engine. \"I go through and see who has the least amount of complaints and issues,\" says Rogers.\nSome cards will give you a range of rates you could get, but often that window is pretty wide, says Nick Bourke, director of the Safe Credit Card Project at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Other cards may offer a specific rate (or terms) and either approve or reject you. If you're operating totally in the dark, you have another option: Apply by phone and push for an answer on your rate and credit line before the account is opened. While there are no guarantees, sometimes you can get an answer, says Bourke.\n\"I've actually done this myself,\" he says, admitting \"you do have to go pretty far in the process.\"\nYou may have to ask for the department that's actually evaluating your application to get an answer, he says. \"The thing that you want to do is when you're talking to the person on the phone taking your application is you want to push them as hard as you can to get your APR and credit line,\" Bourke says. Then, once you have the information and before the account is opened in your name, \"you can say yes or no at that point,\" he says.\nAccording to the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, if a card offers a lower interest rate during an introductory period, the promotional rate has to last at least six months. While that introductory offer may be appealing, the regular rate is what you're really buying. So find out when the introductory APR expires and what the new rate will be. You can find this information online in the terms and conditions for the card or you can ask a service representative. Another smart question: How long is that grace period? \"Some cards start charging interest immediately,\" says Edelman. A card can have different grace periods for balance transfers and cash advances than it does for purchases. You can find information about the grace period in the credit card offer, thanks to federal rules that took effect in 2010. Look for a summary table of rate and fee disclosures, which will include a statement that explains how to avoid paying interest."}
{"title": "How to Calculate Postal Retirement", "text": "The U.S. Postal Service is covered, as are all federal nonmilitary agencies, under the Federal Employment Retirement System (FERS), which pays all of its employees a pension in accordance with how much they were paid during their career, what kind of work they did, and how long they worked for the federal government.\n\nU.S. Postal Service employees have retirement payments available to them.\n\nFERS does not pay enough of a pension to equal a postal employee's working income. This means employees need to use their Social Security and private plans to amass a good retirement income for themselves.\n\nStep\n\nCalculate the average of your three highest-paid consecutive years. For most, this will be your last three years, but exceptions do exist, so look carefully through your salary information.\n\nStep\n\nMultiply your three-year average by 1 percent for each year of service if you are retiring after less than 20 years. So, if you worked for 10 years and your three-year high average was $30,000 a year, then your FERS earnings will be 10 percent (1 percent x 10 years) of that average--$3,000 a year.\n\nStep\n\nMultiply your three-year average by 1.1 percent for each year of service if you worked for 20 years or more and are more than 62 years old. So, if you are 64 years old and worked for 20 years with a three-year high average of $30,000 a year, then your annual pension payment will be 22 percent of $30,000 (20 years x 1.1 percent). This is $6,600 a year."}
{"title": "Capital One Spark Miles: High-Flying Travel Rewards for Your Business", "text": "If you want to rack up travel rewards with a business credit card but don\u2019t spend a lot on travel, the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business is a great option. Rather than reserving its bonus rewards for travel-related purchases, as most travel cards do, this card offers a great ongoing rewards rate regardless of what business expenses you use it for.\nCapital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business: Benefits and basics\nWhat makes the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business so special is that it offers a flat 2 miles for every dollar you spend, no matter what you spend it on \u2014 with no limits and no long list of bonus categories to remember.\nThe card also comes with a stellar sign-up bonus: Plus, a one-time bonus of 50,000 miles once you spend $4,500 on purchases within 3 months of approval. Click here to check out the full details of the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business.\nHigh rewards rate\nMany business credit cards restrict how much you can earn in bonus rewards categories and leave you with a low base rewards rate for all other purchases. This might work if your business spends a lot in those categories and is small enough that you know you won\u2019t reach the spending cap every year. But if you know your business would blow through the spending cap in a few months, or you simply don\u2019t want to be chained to specific categories that may or may not apply to your business, the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business gives you 2 miles per dollar spent on every purchase.\nFlexible redemption\nYou have two options when redeeming miles earned with the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business. First, you can use Capital One\u2019s travel platform, which is run by Orbitz, to book travel using your miles at a rate of $0.01 per mile. Or you can book your travel elsewhere using your Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business and use Capital One\u2019s Purchase Eraser\u00ae to get a full or partial statement credit for your travel purchase.\nWhat makes the Purchase Eraser\u00ae option so unusual is that there is no minimum redemption. Say you purchase a hotel stay for $500; you can redeem as little as $1 worth of points as a partial statement credit for that purchase.\nNerd note: You can also redeem your miles for gift cards, cash and more, but usually at a lower point value.\nNo foreign transaction fees\nLike all Capital One cards, the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business doesn\u2019t charge a foreign transaction fee. With many cards charging 3% of every overseas purchase, you\u2019ll definitely want this feature if you plan to travel internationally.\nCapital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business: Pitfalls and other possibilities\nThe Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business has some great features across the board, but the Nerds have yet to find a perfect card. Here are some drawbacks to consider:\n2X rewards isn\u2019t the best you can do\nIf you think earning double miles for every dollar you spend is about as good as it gets, think again. The Starwood Preferred Guest\u00ae Business Credit Card from American Express gives you 2 Starpoints per dollar spent on purchases charged directly with Starwood Preferred Guest hotels and resorts and 1 Starpoint per dollar on everything else.\nOn the surface, that may seem like a downgrade. What makes it worth your while is the value of a Starpoint. While Capital One miles are worth 1 cent each, Starpoints are worth 2.3 cents apiece on average when redeemed for free stays at Starwood Preferred Guest hotels and resorts. That means you\u2019re getting more bang for your buck when you use the Starwood Preferred Guest\u00ae Business Credit Card from American Express, even at the base rewards rate. You can also transfer your Starpoints to more than 30 airline partners. (Check out our SPG program review to see the list.)\nThe Starwood Preferred Guest\u00ae Business Credit Card from American Express also comes with a sign-up bonus: Earn 25,000 bonus Starpoints\u00ae after you use your new Card to make $5,000 in purchases within the first 3 months. Terms Apply.\nDoesn\u2019t offer good cash-back options\nIf you\u2019re looking for a travel card, you\u2019re in the right place. But if you want the ultimate flexibility of cash, you might want to consider the SimplyCash\u00ae Plus Business Credit Card from American Express. A straight-up cash-back card, it offers great bonus rewards for regular business expenses:\n5% cash back on purchases made at U.S.-based office supply stores and wireless phone service providers.\n3% cash back on a category of your choice.\n1% cash back on all other spending.\nEarn a $200 statement credit after you spend $5,000 in qualifying purchases on your Card within the first 6 months of Card Membership. Plus, earn an additional $200 statement credit after you spend an additional $10,000 or more in qualifying purchases on your Card within the first year of Card Membership. Terms apply.\nThe 5% and 3% bonuses are good on up to $50,000 in combined spending a year; after that, you get 1%.\nIf you have a large one-time business expense coming up, you can also take advantage of the card\u2019s introductory APR of 0% on Purchases for 9 months, and then the ongoing APR of 12.99% - 19.99% Variable APR \u2014 and you\u2019ll also get some extra perks designed specifically for business owners from American Express OPEN. The drawbacks are the cap on spending for the bonus categories and a 2.7% foreign transaction fee.\nIs the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business right for you?\nIf your business spends a lot on non-travel-related expenses and you like to travel, the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business is a solid choice (click here to apply). However, if you\u2019re looking for the flexibility of cash or a better redemption value, it may be worth exploring some other business credit card options."}
{"title": "Health care reform: Socialized medicine?", "text": "insurance\nHealth care reform: Socialized medicine?\nIs America ready for socialized medicine? It's an intriguing question in light of the stormy reception afforded the Affordable Care Act. It's also a reasonable one considering that certain aspects of President Barack Obama's historic health care reform seem to serve as test balloons, and maybe even precursors, for a form of universal health care coverage. To begin to answer the question requires two definitions upfront. 'Socialized medicine' and 'single payer' Socialized medicine is generally defined as a system in which all are insured (\"universal health care\"), all medical facilities are owned and operated by the government, and citizens are charged based on their ability to pay. Great Britain's National Health Service and Soviet bloc health care systems are prime examples. The United States has a limited version of socialized medicine in the Department of Veterans Affairs' VA health system.\nA far more likely universal health care permutation on these shores is what's known as \"single payer.\" Under a single-payer system, health insurance is administered by the government, which serves as the \"single payer\" for health services on behalf of its citizens, who are taxed for it based on their ability to pay. Single-payer systems coexist well with privately owned hospitals and health care providers, as illustrated by the health systems in Canada and Sweden. The U.S. boasts a very popular but limited version of single payer called Medicare. The Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, recently reintroduced in Congress by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., advocates expanding Medicare into a single-payer system to cover all Americans. Single payer has its fans ... A U.S. single-payer movement \"is alive and well,\" in part because of Medicare's enduring popularity, says Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C. \"No matter where you move in the country, you keep your Medicare,\" she says. \"It allows you to go to any doctor or hospital you choose, and it's not wildly expensive given the relatively expensive population it serves.\" Who favors single payer? Obama has offered qualified support, while acknowledging that a single-payer system is not the goal of his health care reform law. In 2009, he said, \"I want to cover everybody. Now, the truth is that, unless you have what's called a single-payer system in which everyone's automatically covered, then you're probably not going to reach every single individual.\" Staunch proponents include the more than 18,000 members of Physicians for a National Health Program, or PNHP, a nonprofit research and education organization of doctors advocating for a single-payer solution. ... and its foes Who's opposed? \"Everyone who makes a living off of health care,\" says Dr. Deb Richter, a family practitioner in Montpelier, Vt., and past president of the PNHP. \"This is big, big money,\" Richter says. \"Nationally, we're spending nearly 18 percent of our (gross domestic product), something like $2.9 trillion a year, on health care. The fact is, single payer stands to wipe out an entire industry that is making a lot of money and has a lot of power. The insurance industry doesn't want it. The drug industry doesn't want it. Even not-for-profits in those sectors are making a lot of money.\" How a US single-payer system might work How would single payer change your health care? For starters, say goodbye to out-of-pocket copays, deductibles and premiums. PNHP says all of that would be replaced by a progressive health care tax, meaning those who can afford it pay more."}
{"title": "Want To Be a Day Trader? Consider Proprietary Trading Firms", "text": "Day trading firms are scattered around the US, Canada, and the world, providing traders with training and the opportunity to trade firm capital, receiving a cut of the profits in exchange. It can be a lucrative business, but also a very tough one. Here's how day trading \"prop firms\" operate and what to expect if you get in.What Are Proprietary Trading FirmsProprietary firms are called such because they each do their own thing. Some firms provide traders with capital and/or training and then receive a cut of the day trader's profits. Other firms make money off of commissions and seat fees (seat fees are paying a fixed a dollar amount each month to maintain your seat on the floor), or a combination of all the above. Proprietary trading firms are structured in different ways. The main proprietary trading firm models are discussed below.What is a Proprietary Day Trader?A day trader working for a proprietary trading firm is typically a contractor, not an employee. Traders are not usually paid an hourly wage or salary and don't receive perks like health care. Instead, the contractor is only paid if they produce a profit, which can take months when starting out (see How Long It Takes to Become a Success Trader).A proprietary day trader trades stocks, currencies, options, and/or futures on major global exchanges, with the express purpose of producing a profit. The day trader has no clients--except for the company he or she is contracted by--so there is no talking on the phone, sales or cold calls. A day trader is not a stock broker or financial advisor. A day trader doesn't care where a stock will be next week or next year, they care about where it could in two or five minutes from now.The types of proprietary day traders vary. Some only trade a few times a day for bigger gains. Other proprietary day traders will make hundreds of small trades a day, jumping in and out of the market. Some will trade the whole day, while others only trade certain hours of the day.Proprietary day traders may work out of an office, where they are initially trained, or some firms allow the trader to work from home. Day traders who are allowed to work from home are typically experienced with a history of success with the firm or are hired as an experienced trader with a proven track record. For further reading, see How to Become a Day Trader.The Perks of Working For a Proprietary Trading Firm (compared to day trading for yourself)Surrounded by other successful traders who can help you get profitable and stay there.Access to more trading capital than you would have on your own (see How Much Capital is Needed to Day Trade Stocks, Forex, or Futures). Reduced commissions (typically) compared to what retail day traders face.Access to training from professional day traders (you may have to pay for training, as this helps the firm eliminate traders who aren't serious).Ability to work from home, if you develop a successful track record (and people to keep you on track until you do).Don't need to worry about the $25,000 minimum account balance for day trading stocks.Cons of Working for a Proprietary Trading Firm (compared to day trading for yourself)Many firms have moved on online because it is cheaper than having a brick and mortar business. This, unfortunately, means you are no longer surrounded by other successful traders when you start out. Chat rooms and Skype are useful tools, but not as effective as having other successful traders there, in person, to answer your questions.With more firms online and fewer physical trading floors, competition for seats on a trading floor is high.Retail technology has improved to a point where the technological advantage of proprietary trading firms is diminished. Retails traders have access to trading platforms and internet speeds which rival most proprietary technology.While the commissions charged by a prop firm may still be lower, active retail day traders, who negotiate with their broker, may be able to get commissions which are close to what would be paid at a prop firm.A day trading firm has to make money. Fees charged by some firms include a seat rental fee, software access fees and/or marked up commissions. A percentage of the profits may also be taken. This is discussed in the section below. If you are considering quitting your current job to day trade for yourself, or for a firm, read Quit Your Job to Day Trade? Steps and Expectations.Typical Proprietary Firm StructureLike any job, you need to get hired. You'll need to submit a resume, cover letter and go through an interview process (see Day Trading as a Career: Don't Make These Resume Mistakes).Proprietary trading firms typically have two model types or a slight variation of these models:The firm takes a cut of your profits, anywhere from 50% to 20%, leaving you with 50% to 80% of your profits. Little or no capital is put up by the trader, although paying for training may be required, as well as a deposit which is held by the firm to offset losses incurred by the trader. Adequate trading capital is provided by the firm (based on experience and skill). With this model, trader profits are the main source of income for the firm. Commissions are typically low (firm makes little or nothing off commissions)...allowing traders to make more, and thus the firm makes more. The firm may also charge a seat rental or software fee. This model is popular in Canada and in other parts of the world. The firm takes little or none your profits, paying you 90% to 100% of your gains. Firms leverage your capital, meaning you need to have your own capital to get started (typically several thousand dollars or more). You get more capital than you would trading on your own, but for this, the firm is going to make money off of training fees, higher commissions, seat fees, and software fees. This model is prevalent in the US.The Day Trading Academy offers proprietary trading in several countries, contact them or another firm in your area for details. To find physical trading floors in your city search \"proprietary trading, YOUR CITY\" on the internet. There is a list of proprietary trading firms here: http://leverageacademy.com/blog/proprietary-trading-shops/, although maintaining an up to date list of firms is difficult since many do not last...always be careful when handing over money to someone else or trusting them with your trades.Day Trading Jobs At a Proprietary Trading Firm - Final WordThere is always a trade-off somewhere. When you work for someone else, they need to make money too. There are benefits to trading for a proprietary trading firm--mainly access to more capital and/or training--but you pay for this in some way. If the training is good, and the capital provided allows you to make more money than you could on your own, it is worth trading for a firm. One model type isn't necessarily better than another, and you may only have access to one model depending on where you live. Which firm is best for you depends on how much you trade and your capital and training requirements.If you are new to day trading, then training is important. You want to be trained by people who produce successful traders and are not just making money off of training fees. If you are an experienced trader, then training isn't as important. Instead, your focus should be on finding the most competitive structure possible so more of your profits stay in your pocket. But at the same time, you want the firm to be financially sound enough (which means they still need to be making money) so you can trade with confidence and they are there to help you out when you need them."}

Why do I need this card?\" says Bruce McClary, media director for ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions, a nonprofit affiliated with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling Some positive reasons: The card has low or no fees, a lower interest rate or offers a rewards program that suits your spending habits. \"It has to make sense, and it has to fit into your overall lifestyle,\" McClary says. Do you pay off your credit card balances every month? If so, \"you don't care what the interest rate is because you won't pay any,\" says Ric Edelman, author of \"The Truth About Money.\" \"But you care about the (annual) fee,\" he says. If you run a balance, you want the lowest rate you can get, even if that comes with an annual fee.\nOne clue to your usage: \"Look at your past history,\" says Edelman. \"Because what you've done before is what you will be doing.\"\nIf you're shopping for a card, chances are you're comparing card terms. But if an issuer sends you an offer, it's tempting to apply and see what you get. \"It's really difficult to pick one (in isolation),\" says Kelly Rogers, chief development officer for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Orange County and adjunct faculty at Chapman University. \"If someone just shows you one car, how do you know if it's the right car for you?\" Her advice: Do a side-by-side comparison of several different cards before you apply. Don't be afraid to plug the card name, \"complaints\" and \"customer service\" into your favorite search engine. \"I go through and see who has the least amount of complaints and issues,\" says Rogers.\nSome cards will give you a range of rates you could get, but often that window is pretty wide, says Nick Bourke, director of the Safe Credit Card Project at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Other cards may offer a specific rate (or terms) and either approve or reject you. If you're operating totally in the dark, you have another option: Apply by phone and push for an answer on your rate and credit line before the account is opened. While there are no guarantees, sometimes you can get an answer, says Bourke.\n\"I've actually done this myself,\" he says, admitting \"you do have to go pretty far in the process.\"\nYou may have to ask for the department that's actually evaluating your application to get an answer, he says. \"The thing that you want to do is when you're talking to the person on the phone taking your application is you want to push them as hard as you can to get your APR and credit line,\" Bourke says. Then, once you have the information and before the account is opened in your name, \"you can say yes or no at that point,\" he says.\nAccording to the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, if a card offers a lower interest rate during an introductory period, the promotional rate has to last at least six months. While that introductory offer may be appealing, the regular rate is what you're really buying. So find out when the introductory APR expires and what the new rate will be. You can find this information online in the terms and conditions for the card or you can ask a service representative. Another smart question: How long is that grace period? \"Some cards start charging interest immediately,\" says Edelman. A card can have different grace periods for balance transfers and cash advances than it does for purchases. You can find information about the grace period in the credit card offer, thanks to federal rules that took effect in 2010. Look for a summary table of rate and fee disclosures, which will include a statement that explains how to avoid paying interest."}
{"title": "Fund roth 401(k) and roth ira at the same time?", "text": "Dear Dr. Don,\nI participate in a Roth 401(k) at work with employer matching contributions. I also have a Roth individual retirement account through a financial company. If I contribute $5,500 to my work\u2019s 401(k), may I also save $5,500 in my personal Roth IRA, or would I be limited to $5,500 in total contributions between the two?\nAs I understand it, I can contribute up to $17,500 to my 401(k) per year and $5,500 to my personal Roth IRA.\nThanks,\n\u2014 Matt Morass\nDear Matt,\nHaving a Roth 401(k) plan at work doesn\u2019t limit your ability to contribute to your personal Roth IRA. Depending on your income, however, you may have to fund a traditional IRA and then do a Roth IRA conversion.\nYou can always contribute to a traditional IRA up to the annual contribution limits as long as you have sufficient compensation or salary. There are income limits dictating whether you can contribute to a Roth IRA. The limits depend on your filing status and your modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI. If you can\u2019t contribute directly to a Roth IRA, then you can contribute to a traditional IRA and then perform a Roth IRA conversion.\nSince your employer has a retirement plan in place, there may also be limits on making tax-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA. This depends on your filing status and MAGI.\nAt a minimum, I like to see people contribute to their retirement plan at work up to the limit of the company\u2019s matching program, if there is one. With a Roth 401(k) plan, your contributions are made with after-tax dollars. But the qualified distributions are tax-free, which can be nice when you are retired. The company-matching contributions go into a separate pretax account. Of course, traditional 401(k) accounts are taxable when payments are distributed out of the plan.\nGet more news, money-saving tips and expert advice by signing up for a free Bankrate newsletter.\nAsk the adviser To ask a question of Dr. Don, go to the \u201cAsk the Experts\u201d page and select one of these topics: \u201cFinancing a home,\u201d \u201cSaving & Investing,\u201d \u201cSenior Living\u201d or \u201cMoney.\u201d Read more Dr. Don columns for additional personal finance advice.\nBankrate\u2019s content, including the guidance of its advice-and-expert columns and this website, is intended only to assist you with financial decisions.

{"title": "Best Places for Young Families in Tennessee", "text": "Tennessee is a state on the rise. According to the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress, public school test scores have improved faster in Tennessee than they have in any other state.\nHome prices are rising as well. According to real estate website Zillow.com, median Tennessee home values have increased by 3.8% over the past year to $129,400, and they\u2019re projected to grow 3.4% over the next year \u2014 outpacing nationwide projections of 2.6%.\nThese factors present opportunity and challenge for families looking to settle in the Volunteer State. It\u2019s a state with many good school districts and varied, affordable housing, often in smaller communities outside larger cities such as Nashville and Memphis. Although rising home prices are good for existing homeowners, they\u2019re an obstacle for potential homebuyers.\nAffording a home can be particularly difficult for young families, whose budgets are often tighter. NerdWallet set out to identify Tennessee\u2019s top places for young families that offer a combination of reasonable home prices, well-rated schools and low crime. Keep in mind that not every place at the top of our list hit the highest mark in all categories.\n\nGET EXPERT ANSWERS TO YOUR MORTGAGE QUESTIONS Get personalized help from an unbiased mortgage broker. Understand your options and find the best rates. Get Started\nCOMPARE MORTGAGE RATES FOR FREE See personalized mortgage rates in seconds using our comprehensive mortgage tool. Check Rates\nNerdWallet\u2019s analysis\nBy statistically comparing such factors as home affordability, income growth, education and a crime risk score, NerdWallet identified the best places to start your search for the Tennessee community that\u2019s right for you. Here\u2019s what our analysis of 98 places with a population over 5,000 turned up.\n\nBest places for young families in Tennessee\n1. Mount Carmel\nMount Carmel, in the northeast corner of the state, benefits from an affordable median home value of $127,900 and a GreatSchools rating of 8 out of 10. Its crime risk score is \u201cmost safe,\u201d the highest possible, and families with kids make up roughly a third of the town\u2019s households. Mount Carmel, which placed third in our previous analysis, is less than 10 miles from Kingsport and the 3,550-acre Bays Mountain Park.\n2. Atoka\nGrabbing second place for the second year in a row, Atoka received high scores in all of our categories, including a 9 out of 10 for its schools from GreatSchools.org and a crime risk grade of \u201cmost safe.\u201d Atoka, which is 25 miles north of Memphis, features family events year-round, good for the 33.5% of households consisting of families with children.\n3. Lakeland\nAlthough Lakeland\u2019s $226,800 median home value in 2014 is high for Tennessee, living there comes with sizeable benefits. The city of 13,000 was one of only four communities in our study to receive a perfect 10 from GreatSchools. Lakeland also earned our best risk rating of \u201cmost safe,\u201d and its 15-year income growth rate of 69.8% was second-highest in our survey. The northeast Memphis suburb is home to the 235-acre Garner Lake, with its many recreational opportunities.\n4. White House\nWhite House\u2019s history as a popular stop for stagecoach travelers is on display at the White House Inn Museum. The town of about 11,000 is 25 miles north of downtown Nashville, with its many cultural events as the nation\u2019s country music capital. The 2014 median home value in White House was $168,700; its schools earn a solid rating of 8 out of 10, and its 15-year income growth rate of 42.6% far outpaces the state average. White House rose two spots from its rank in our study last year, likely because this year\u2019s data include the crime risk score, for which the town earned a \u201csafe\u201d grade.\n5. Spring Hill\nThe largest community in our top 10, Spring Hill, 30 miles south of Nashville, has seen its population surge to more than 32,000 from just under 8,000 in the 2000 census. The town is best known as the former location of General Motors\u2019 Saturn manufacturing facility, which has continued as a flexible assembly plant following GM\u2019s shuttering of the brand in 2009. Spring Hill received a 9 out of 10 rating from GreatSchools. The median home value for Spring Hill in 2014 was $198,200, making homes there generally more expensive than elsewhere in the state.\n6. Nolensville\nAlso in the Nashville area, Nolensville counts a whopping 52.5% of its households as families with children. It received the best crime risk grading of \u201cmost safe\u201d and a 10 out of 10 from GreatSchools.org. But living here isn\u2019t cheap compared to the rest of Tennessee: The median home value is $293,500.\n7. Paris\nThe most affordable city on our list to have received a score of 8 or higher from GreatSchools, Paris has a median home value of just $81,200. Over the past 20 years, the city\u2019s infrastructure has been revitalized, including a restoration of 1920s-era architecture to the downtown shopping area. Worth noting: The city received a crime risk score of \u201cleast safe,\u201d and nearly a third of families in poverty include young children.\n8. Kingston\nKingston, roughly a half-hour west of Knoxville, jumped up from 24th on our list last year, likely because of its increased rating of 9 from GreatSchools, as well as the inclusion of our crime score, for which Kingston received \u201csafe\u201d marks. Housing is relatively affordable, with a median value of $127,400. Kingston is home to a Tennessee Valley Authority coal plant, one of the largest such facilities in the country.\n9. Bloomingdale\nAn unincorporated area just outside of Kingsport, Bloomingdale grabs our No. 9 spot largely thanks to its affordable median home value of $90,900. Bloomingdale received a crime risk rating of \u201csafe\u201d and a GreatSchools score of 8. One point of concern here is economic opportunity \u2014 median income in Bloomingdale has grown only 7.5% since 1999, which is well below the 23.3% average growth of communities statewide.\n10. Dayton\nLocated next to several wildlife refuge and outdoor recreation areas, including Armstrong Ferry Recreation Area, Dayton provides a balanced quality of life at below-median home values. The town is best known as the site of the Scopes trial in 1925, which focused on evolution versus creationism. The community of 7,300 is home to Bryan College, a four-year Christian liberal arts college named after William Jennings Bryan, the prosecutor in the trial.\nBest places for young families in

Certain places were excluded due to lack of data points or requirements for residency. Our methodology focused on four factors:\nHome affordability. Home affordability, 30% of the total score, was calculated by averaging index scores for median home value and median selected monthly owner costs \u2014 which includes costs like taxes and mortgages \u2014 for the year 2014. The lower the costs, the higher the score. Data came from the American Community Survey, a division of the U.S. Census Bureau.\nGrowth and prosperity. Growth and prosperity are 20% of the total score. The two metrics were growth in family income from 1999 to 2014, and median family income in 2014. Data are from the American Community Survey.\nFamily friendliness. To measure whether an area is a good place for families, which is 20% of our total score, we looked at the percentage of married couples with at least one child under age 18, the average crime score as provided by NeighborhoodScout, and the percentage of families in poverty with at least one child under age 5.\nEducational quality. Using data from GreatSchools.org, every place was given a 1-10 score, with 10 being the highest (read more about the methodology here). Education is 30% of the total score.\nImage via iStock."}
{"title": "Pros and Cons of Interest Only Loans", "text": "An interest only loan is a loan that you only make interest payments on (until the interest only period ends, which is often five to ten years). Because you\u2019re only paying interest charges each month \u2013 as opposed to interest plus a portion of your loan balance (also known as the principal) \u2013 your payments are lower than they\u2019d be with a traditional amortizing loan.To calculate the payment on an interest only loan, calculate the loan balance by the interest rate. For example, if you owe $100,000 at 5%, you\u2019d owe $5,000 per year or $416.67 per month.Have our interest only loan calculator do the math for youNext, compare interest only payments to fully amortizing loan paymentsInterest only loans eventually convert to standard amortizing loans (with higher payments) after the \u201cinterest only period\u201d ends \u2013 typically five or ten years.Benefits of Interest Only LoansInterest only mortgages are appealing because your monthly payments are lower. What are some popular reasons (or temptations) for going with a lower payment?Buy a more expensive property: an interest only loan allows you to buy a more expensive home than you would be able to afford with a standard fixed rate mortgage. Lenders calculate how much you can borrow based (in part) on your monthly income, using a debt to income ratio. With lower required payments on an interest only loan, the amount you can borrow goes up significantly. If you\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll be able to afford a more expensive property \u2013 plus you\u2019re willing and able to take the risk that things won\u2019t go according to plan \u2013 an interest only loan makes it possible.Free up money: lower payments also allow you to choose how and where you put your money. If you want, you can certainly put extra money towards your mortgage each month, more or less mirroring a standard \u201cfully amortizing\u201d payment. Or, you can invest the money in something else (like a business or other financial goals) \u2013 you get to choose. Most house flipping loans are imterest only in order to maximize the amount of money going towards improvements.Keep costs low: sometimes an interest only payment is the only payment you\u2019ll be able to afford. You might choose an inexpensive property but still come up short on monthly funds. Interest only loans give you an alternative to paying rent \u2013 but there are risks to taking this route.It\u2019s important to distinguish between true benefits and the temptation of a lower payment. Interest only loans only work when you use them properly \u2013 as part of a strategy (and not just a way to keep your expenses low).For example, they\u2019re a good option when you have irregular income (if you get variable bonuses or commissions instead of a steady monthly paycheck, for example). It might work to keep your monthly obligations low and make large lump-sum payments to reduce your principal when you have extra money. Of course, you have to actually follow through on that plan.You can also customize your amortization schedule with an interest only loan. See How Amortization Works for details on how amortization affects your mortgage. In many cases, your additional payment against principal will result in a lower required payment in following months (because the principal amount that you\u2019re paying interest on has decreased). Check with your lender, as some loans won\u2019t adjust the payment (or the payment doesn\u2019t get adjusted immediately).Drawbacks of Interest OnlyThat lower monthly payment comes at a cost. So what do you give up when you only pay interest on your loan?No equity: you don\u2019t build equity in your home with an interest only mortgage. You can build equity if you make extra payments, but the loan does not encourage that by design. You\u2019ll have a harder time using home equity loans in the future if you ever need cash for upgrades.Underwater risk: paying down your loan balance is helpful for numerous reasons. One of them is reducing your risk when it comes time to sell. If your home loses value after you buy, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll owe more on the home than you can sell it for (known as being upside-down or underwater). If that happens, you\u2019ll have to write a large check just to sell your home.Putting off the inevitable: you\u2019re going to have to pay off the loan someday, and interest only loans make that day more difficult \u2013 the day will come. We like to believe that we\u2019ll be in a better position in the future, but it\u2019s wise to just buy what you can comfortably afford now.If you just pay interest, you\u2019ll owe exactly the same amount of money in 10 years that you owe now \u2013 you\u2019re just servicing a debt instead of paying it off or improving your situation.Example: assume that you buy a home for $300,000 and you borrow 80% (or $240,000). If you make interest only payments, you\u2019ll owe $240,000 on that home (until the interest only period ends). If the home loses value and is worth only $280,000 when you sell it, you won\u2019t get your full $60,000 from the down payment back. If the price drops below $240,000 when you sell, you\u2019ll have to pay out of pocket to repay your lender and get the lien on your home removed.Of course, you have to pay your loan off one way or another. Usually, you end up selling the home or refinancing the mortgage to pay off an interest only loan. If you end up keeping the loan and the house, you\u2019ll eventually have to start paying principal with each monthly payment. Again, this conversion might happen after 10 years. Your loan agreement will explain exactly when the interest only period ends and what happens next.Interest only loans aren\u2019t necessarily bad. But they\u2019re often used for the wrong reasons. If you\u2019ve got a solid strategy for alternative uses for the money you\u2019d otherwise pay towards principal (and a strategy for getting rid of the debt), then they can work well. Choosing an interest only loan for the sole purpose of buying a more expensive home is a risky approach."}
{"title": "What is a PSA - Pooling and Servicing Agreement?", "text": "A PSA is an acronym for Pooling and Servicing Agreement. This is a contract that is created when mortgage loans are bundled into a mortgage-based security and sold to investors. The security is now the owner of the mortgages included in the bundle. A homeowner may want to find the PSA in which their loan has been bundled, especially during foreclosure proceedings.How Mortgage Loans are Securitized and a PSA CreatedMany mortgage loans are securitized. You may not realize your loan has been sold off in this way. The loan originator, such as the bank or mortgage lender, gathers hundreds of loans into one package. That is the pooling part of the PSA acronym. The originator often bundles loans of a similar type and quality. Your loan is now part of a pool and will become a securitized mortgage loan.The pool of mortgages becomes a marketable security or mortgage-backed security and is sold on the secondary market. Often the purchaser is a trust. Trusts are comprised of investors, who will receive payments from the trust. Just as your mortgage interest went originally to the bank, now it goes to the trust and will become part of the payment to the investors in the security.After the loans are pooled and sold, the trust hires a service provider to collect monthly payments and distribute that money to the investors. That securitization agreement is called a pooling and servicing agreement or PSA. The pooling and servicing agreement is filed with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) if the securitization was public.The PSA controls what can and can't be done with the trust. It spells out the rights, duties and obligations of all of the parties involved. It determines how the servicer is paid and where fees paid on the mortgages will go. Importantly for the homeowner, it also spells out how payments are collected, how mortgage loans may be modified and the process of foreclosure.Finding Your Pooling and Servicing AgreementHomeowners whose loans are securitized and who are facing foreclosure or who want a loan modification may benefit from finding their Pooling and Servicing Agreement. It may be part of a prospectus rather than a stand-alone document. If the securitization was public, you can find the documents on the www.sec.gov website.To find your PSA, you will need the name of the original lender and the title of the pool of loans. Finding the title takes some detective work on the SEC website. You can find the name of your lender and the date on your promissory note and deed of trust. The date the loan was made is useful in finding your PSA on the SEC website. Search by the name of the lender and find documents filed in the year of your loan. Find the PSA, prospectus and prospectus supplement.Once you have found the documents, note their document number and names and save or bookmark them. You can contact the SEC to obtain a certified copy. You may need a lawyer to help analyze it."}

{"title": "Small Business Accounting With Quickbooks - An Interview with Quickbooks expert Camille Wright (page 2/3)", "text": "While I was at the BlogHer conference in San Francisco, I got a chance to talk to Camille Wright, bookkeeping consultant to small businesses. Her firm, Wright Solution, teaches small business owners how to keep track of their finances and get a better picture of how their companies are doing.Three key points in this interview with Camille Wright, a small business consultant, and QuickBooks expert:Most small businesses (especially sole proprietors) have no idea how their business is doing financially because they don't have well-maintained books. Many users of financial software, like Quickbooks, are not fully utilizing the power of modern day accounting software. Intuit has a ton of different versions of their Quickbooks (business accounting) and Quicken (personal finance) software. There's probably a version specifically catering to your business.After the conference, Camille graciously answered more questions in the following interview:1. What are some of the most overlooked tax deductions for probloggers and online entrepreneurs? Which deductions are the most misunderstood?I think the most overlooked deduction by far is mileage. Since most bloggers work out of their homes, all miles driven from that site to anywhere that is business related will qualify as a business deduction. With the federal mileage rate currently at $.585 per mile, this could be a sizable deduction.I would say that the most misunderstood deduction is the \u2018Office In Home\u2019 deduction. IRS has very specific guidelines relating to work space in the home and if business owners choose to claim this deduction they need to be sure that the space falls within the parameters set by IRS.This isn\u2019t really a deduction, but I find that the most overlooked item for a small business that files as sole proprietors is the self-employment tax that they are liable for and required to pay in installments four times a year. Self-employment tax (social security and medicare) is approximately 15.3% of your net business income. That can be a huge amount due at the end of the year if you have not been making the properly estimated payments throughout the year as required. And of course, you will need to add on interest due on the underpayment as well.2. Many online entrepreneurs think that since they don't make a lot of money they don't need to worry about accounting. Do you agree with that? If you don't, how do you talk them into changing their thinking?This is an easy question for me. If you don\u2019t keep accurate records how do you know if you are making money or not?Although, it\u2019s not only knowing if you are making money but also how are you using the money that you do make.Many small business owners are what we consider \u2018shoe box\u2019 clients which mean that they show up once a year at their accountant\u2019s office with the envelope full of receipts or they present pages and pages of Excel spreadsheets. Either way, they have no idea how they are doing (other than they have money in their bank account) until their accountant tells them after he has deciphered all those pieces of paper. It can be a real shock to find out that you owe money on your taxes when you thought you hadn\u2019t made enough to owe anything.In addition, I find bookkeeping invaluable as a budgeting tool. If you keep current with recording your income and expenses you will be able to see monthly at a glance when you\u2019re busy times are and when you might need to boost your marketing to draw in more business.It can also show you exactly when and how much you are spending on various expenses for your business. By looking at your expenses on a monthly basis you can determine when and how much money you might typically need to cover those expenses. On the other hand, it can show you which items you might be spending too much on so you can figure a way to cut them down in the future or spread them out in a different way.3. Do you have any suggestions on how to pick a good accountant?I\u2019d like to say that all accountants know what they\u2019re doing, but I haven\u2019t always found that to be the case. The best thing I can say is to shop around. Not only do you need to find someone that has the necessary knowledge, but also someone who is willing to work with you, be there when you have a question or a problem. During a short conversation with a potential accountant, you should be able to tell if you click.One last thing about accountants, just because they have a CPA designation doesn\u2019t mean they will be the best fit for you. You do want someone that knows the rules, but you should also look for someone that can work and grow with you.4. You've been consulting small business owners for almost two decades. Do you think online entrepreneurs (probloggers, eBay sellers, web 2.0 people) have different accounting needs compared to people who start brick and mortar businesses? Do they face different challenges?Really, business is business. We all work with numbers to tell our story. Although, I think one problem facing online entrepreneurs would be the integration of their financial records with standard software. We all know that programming is here today and obsolete tomorrow so it is up to the accounting software industry to keep pace with the needs of the online community.There are many third party software companies that have and are continuing to develop programs that will work as add-ons to standard accounting software. These come in basic or industry specific programs so it is all a matter of finding the best fit for your business.5. Can you tell us a little bit about how you started Wright Solution and why you wanted to work with small businesses?I have always looked at business as a kind of game, a puzzle and I love puzzles. There is a place and reason for everything and the business person just needs to find out how to put all the pieces together to tell their story.The problem I saw early on was that most startups or small businesses were focused on the operation of their business. This is what they should do but they tend to leave out the basics that will show them if what they are doing is effective and profitable.When I work with small businesses I enjoy watching the light bulb go on when they see the accurate picture of how their business is operating financially.6. You are a member of Intuit's accountant speaker bureau. Can you tell us why you decided to work with Intuit?When several of my clients asked me to look into QuickBooks for them, I spent some time learning all I could about the program. Over the years I have found that many people that use the program don\u2019t really have a grasp of what they are doing or the power of the program, so much of my time is spent correcting work or training my clients on the program.The Intuit Speakers Bureau is made up of professionals like myself that enjoy helping people to make the most of the products that Intuit produces. I hate to see people struggle when all they may need is a little guidance to set them on the right path.QuickBooks products are an affordable solution for the small business owner and I realized that if I wanted to stay in business myself I needed to become proficient in the products that my clients used.7. You were recently featured as a business expert at BlogHer's San Francisco conference, the premier blogging conference for women. What were some of the most commonly asked questions from the women bloggers?Most of the women I talked to were very early into their businesses so were looking for information on how they should structure their business: as a sole proprietor, an LLC or a corporation.There were also questions about whether they really needed to file a tax return if they weren\u2019t making much money.Then, of course, there were the standard questions about how much they could write off for the different expenses they incur.8. I've heard from many small business clients that QuickBooks have a lot of features that they don't use because they don't have the time to explore and learn. Where can they go find competent help? Both for free and for more extensive consulting.The QuickBooks ProAdvisor database is a great place to find help. It\u2019s also accessible within any QuickBooks program. This is not a free service and not backed by Intuit, the people listed on the database are small business owners themselves and charge a wide range of fees depending on their proficiency in various areas. Just like finding an accountant, if you need help from a ProAdvisor, I would suggest that you call several to find the right fit for you.For free help, you can join the QuickBooks Online Community. Here you can ask QuickBook Experts and other QuickBook users how to use specific features.9. Intuit has a lot of new products that seem like they would be helpful to small business owners. But there're so many options. Where should a new small business owner go to find the right product(s) to get started with?A good place to start is by going to quickbooks.com and clicking on Products & Services. Here you can see a map of all Intuit products and services for small businesses from financial software and payroll solutions to Website creation and payment services.The one thing I would add is that when shopping for which product would be the best fit if you are just starting out, smaller in size, and pretty basic, I would go with a more basic version instead of jumping right into the most expensive version. All versions are rewritten every year with new bells and whistles so you can upgrade to a more robust version within a year if it is necessary. You want to start with a program that is adequate for your current needs, but not too complicated and expensive that it will overwhelm you right off the bat.If you have relatively simple financial needs, you might want to start with QuickBooks Simple Start, a free basic version of QuickBooks, and upgrade to a more robust version if you need more functionality later on.10. Billing Manager looks like a great tool for freelance workers. Can you tell us a bit about what you like about it and how it compares to other Web-based invoicing tools like Blinksale or FreshBooks?Intuit Billing Manager helps small service businesses including freelancers create and manage their invoices online. It\u2019s primarily for business owners who are using Excel and Word and want a more effective way to manage their invoices but aren\u2019t yet ready to get QuickBooks. What I like about Billing Manager is that it\u2019s a stepping stone to accounting software and definitely better than spreadsheets. It\u2019s simple to use, letting you send out invoices with minimal effort, and it\u2019s free at billingmanager.com -- you can\u2019t beat that.I\u2019m not that familiar with Freshbooks and Blinksale so I can\u2019t comment on how they compare directly with Billing Manager. I can say though that Billing Manager is from Intuit so it\u2019s here to stay and it integrates well with other Intuit products like the company\u2019s payment solutions. So once you\u2019ve invoiced a customer, you can get paid faster by accepting their online credit card payment.[Editor's note: Here are my reviews of the top Web-based invoicing apps.]11. Many semi-pro bloggers earn a few hundred (or thousand) dollars a month. They're using Excel spreadsheets and want a more robust (but still affordable) accounting system. What do you recommend?As I mentioned earlier, I think any accounting system is better than spreadsheets or envelopes. There are several software packages on the market, but I feel that the QuickBooks products are a perfect fit for the small business owner. The programs range from the most basic to a product that can handle million dollar businesses that need more functionality.One of the best things about QuickBooks is the price. I have consulted with clients that have spent many thousands of dollars on larger name products and have not had favorable experiences. QuickBooks is an affordable solution for small businesses that need to get up and running in a short period of time without much hassle. As time goes on and they outgrow the program, they can move on to a higher end product, but starting out I think QuickBooks is the best way to go.I know I probably sound like a QuickBooks salesperson, but I have dealt with many small businesses and have found the programs to work very well for them.Again, remember that the key is not really the software program you use, but that you use something to organize your records in one place to give you the best picture of your business at any given moment.12. Can you give us some examples of how an online entrepreneur can use QuickBooks to get organized?QuickBooks can be used by any business, online or not. It is all a matter of setting up a file to do exactly what you need. There are basics of accounting that need to be followed, but after that, it is time to play and design a program to fit your specific needs. A couple of possibilities would be customizing invoices featuring your own personal flair or setting up different categories to track various divisions of your business. There are many ways to use QuickBooks beyond the basics, it just takes some thought and time to design the program to get the information that is most important to help you run your business.13. Can the online version completely replace my desktop QuickBooks software? Will I need to upgrade to a desktop version later?QuickBooks Online Plus does not have an identical set of features to that of other QuickBooks desktop products. It\u2019s best for service-based businesses that need to access their books remotely and/or allow multiple people to work simultaneously. Some of its features are unique while many are the same or similar to other QuickBooks products. You can check out this chart for a side-by-side comparison of online and desktop versions of Quickbooks. Since QuickBooks Online is different from the desktop versions, it\u2019s best to decide if it\u2019s right for you from the start rather than changing to the desktop version later on."}

{"title": "3 Alternatives When You Can&#39;t Pay Your Income Taxes On Time", "text": "What happens if tax day rolls around and you just can't come up with the money to pay your Federal income tax? The penalties for filing late and paying late can be steep. Keep in mind, there are separate penalties for filing late and paying late. The \"failure to file\" penalty is much worse than the \"failure to pay\" penalty (please note that the interest rates used in these examples vary each quarter).To reduce your penalties and interest, file your income tax return by the due date. You'll still incur interest, but you'll avoid the penalty for failure to pay on time. Current penalties are as follows:Failure to file on time penalty: 5% of the balance due per monthFailure to pay on time penalty: up to 1% of the balance due per month,up to a total of 25% of the balance dueFor example, if you don't file your return by the due date, and you owe $2,000, you'll pay a combined failure to file and failure to pay \u200bpenalty of $120 per month until paid in full, up to a maximum of $500. If you owed $10,000, the penalty would be $600 per month, up to a maximum of $2,500.If you file on time but don't pay on time, you'll incur a late payment penalty of 1% of the tax owed for each month, or part of a month, that the tax remains unpaid, up to a maximum of 25%.For example, if you file your return by the due date but don't pay your balance of $2,000, you'll pay a late payment penalty of $20 per month. If your balance due is $10,000, your penalty will be $60 per month. As you can see, your penalties are significantly lower if you file your return on time even if you don't pay the taxes due.Alternatives to Paying Income Taxes By DeadlineConsider the alternatives available to you. If your cash shortage is a temporary one, can you get a pay advance at work? Do you have family members who would be willing to lend you the money? Do you have something of value that you could sell to raise the cash? Can you take a draw on your home equity line of credit?Use a Credit CardYou can charge your taxes on your credit card (American Express, MasterCard, Visa or Discover Card) by contacting a service provider approved by the IRS. You'll be charged a convenience fee of around 2.5% of the amount you're paying, so if you owe $2,000, the fee will be around $50. If you owe $10,000, the fee will be around $250. Don't forget that you'll incur interest charges if you can't pay your credit card balance off quickly. Two service providers you can consider making your payment to are Pay1040 and Official Payments Corporation. If you are uncertain about paying through a service provider, call the IRS for more information.Negotiate an Installment PlanIf you simply can't come up with the money to pay the taxes when due, you may be able to negotiate an installment payment plan with the IRS. Complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, and attach it to the front of your income tax return. Include the amount you propose to pay each month and the day of the month you'd like to make your payments. The IRS will notify you if you're approved.There's a $43 fee for setting up the installment agreement,and you'll incur interest on the balance due.What If You Just Can't Come Up With the Money Now, or in the Foreseeable Future?If you owe so much that there's no way you'll ever be able to pay it, the IRS may accept less than the full amount through a program called Offer in Compromise. Complete Form 656, Offer in Compromise, and Form 433A, Collection Information Statement and submit them to the IRS with the $150 application fee.You'll have to provide a complete personal financial statement including everything you own of value, all the debts you owe, your income, and the amount you're prepared to pay immediately in order to settle your account.The IRS will evaluate your financial situation and future income potential to determine whether to accept your settlement offer. If the IRS believes it won't be able to collect the full amount, your offer may be accepted. This program is for people in dire financial straits.Regardless of an installment plan or Offer in Compromise agreement, the IRS will require you to pay all your federal tax liabilities on time for the next five years or until the amount you settled on is paid in full, whichever is longer. If you default on the terms of the Offer in Compromise agreement, all of your back taxes will once again be due in full. The IRS may file a lien on your property to ensure payment, and this will show up on your credit report.The Bottom LineThis can all be very confusing, but the bottom line is this: even if you can't pay your taxes due, don't compound your problems by failing to file your income tax return. You could end up paying penalties totaling half the amount you owe, before interest is even added on!"}

By researching several different \"best\" lists, job hunters can easily identify a variety of ways that a retail company would be a best fit retail employer.  But the research that identifies the worst retail companies to work for is more difficult to find.Few organizations are brave enough to release \"worst\" lists.  We can only imagine the backlash that happens when a multi-billion dollar retailing company is identified as the \"worst\" in any way.  However, Glassdoor.com is one organization that dared to compile and make public a \"Worst Companies to Work For\" list beginning in 2008, based on voluntary employee surveys that evaluate eight workplace factors:Senior LeadershipCommunicationEmployee MoraleCareer OpportunitiesWork/Life BalanceCompensation and BenefitsRecognition and FeedbackFairness and RespectGlassdoor stopped publishing its \u201cworst employers\u201d list after 2009, but using the data available on the Glassdoor website, 24/7 Wall St. has been creating its own Worst Workplaces list since 2012, based on its research and analysis of the ratings, rankings, and comments which are publicly available on Glassdoor.com.  More than half of the companies on the 2015 Worst Companies to Work For list are retail companies. While this doesn't speak particularly well for the retail industry as a whole, it is even more damaging to the individual retail companies that are consistently ranked by their employees as one of the bad, worse, and worst places to work in America.  The worst retail employer in 2015 - Dillard's - has been ranked as one of the worst retail companies to work for for the past four years in a row.  The same goes for Sears and Kmart, except they somehow managed to escape the wrath of their employees in 2014. Being a multi-year \"worst employer\" doesn't help the Dillard's or Sears/Kmart recruiting efforts at any level in the retail organization.  And it also doesn't help recruiters in the largest U.S. retail chains, which prospective employees tend to consider to be guilty by association of bad employment practices. What follows is a list of retail companies that have been ranked as the worst retail employers between 2015 and 2008, when the survey results were first published. The number in the left column indicates the \"worst\" ranking that each retail company was assigned according to survey results, compared to all U.S. companies in all industries.

{"title": "New standards change home loan landscape", "text": "mortgage\nNew standards change home loan landscape\nWhen the nation's housing market boomed in the first few years of the 21st century, it was notoriously easy to get approval for a new mortgage. If you had a pulse, chances were good that a home loan was within your grasp. That all changed when the housing bubble burst. In recent years, lenders have remained cautious about offering mortgages, says Brent W. Ambrose, director of the Institute for Real Estate Studies at the Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pa. But Ambrose says stricter lending standards are not necessarily a bad thing. He adds that prospective homeowners can take steps to improve their odds of securing a home loan. Ambrose expands on those thoughts in the following interview. During the housing boom, it was said that anyone who could \"fog a mirror\" could get a mortgage loan. In recent years, however, it has become much more difficult to get financing. How has this tightening of the purse strings impacted the housing market?\nWe are living in an unusual time. Mortgage rates remain at historically low levels due to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. That is helping support the housing market, and we are seeing signs of that support in the form of rising house prices. In addition, demand is finally catching up with supply, and thus the inventory of unsold homes is declining. However, mortgage underwriting standards have increased significantly compared to the period prior to the financial crisis. As a result, potential borrowers are finding it more difficult to qualify for mortgage credit. Thus, we are seeing signs that many large investors are moving into the single-family rental business, with some evidence that the demand that is leading to increasing house prices is coming from investors looking for rental properties and not from traditional homeowners. This situation is not necessarily negative, since households who rent their dwelling do not have capital tied up in an illiquid asset and are more mobile in response to changes in employment opportunities. Over the past year, has it gotten any easier to obtain a loan? Or are lenders continuing to be extremely cautious? Recent evidence from the Federal Reserve's survey of senior bank officers indicates that lending/underwriting standards for residential mortgages remain unchanged. Thus, borrowers will still find that underwriting standards are more strict than during the period prior to the financial crisis."}
{"title": "How to Calculate the Price of Treasury Bills", "text": "Federal governments sell Treasury bills, also called T-bills, as a way to raise short-term funds. The United Kingdom issued the first T-bill in 1877. In the United States, you can buy Treasury bills with maturity dates ranging from several days up to one year. The minimum purchase amount is $100. The maximum limit varies: $5 million in non-competitive auctions or 35 percent of the offering amount in competitive auctions. You can buy T-bills directly from the Treasury website or through a bank or broker. Calculate the price of Treasury bills to decide if the investment should be part of your portfolio.Research the discount either online (see Resources) or call your bank or brokerage. The government sells T-bills at less than face value, known as a discount from par. The rate changes weekly except for the 52-week bills and the cash-management bills. The U.S. Treasury auctions the 52-week T-bills every four weeks. They auction cash-management bills irregularly.Calculate the discount amount. For example, the Treasury advertises $10,000 T-bills at a discount of 1.5 percent: $10,000 x .015 = $150. The discount in this example is $150. If the discount is zero, then you will pay face value and will not earn interest. Institutional investors may buy Treasury bills at face value as a way to park money when the stock market is volatile. The government issuing the T-bills guarantees them.Deduct the discount from the face value: $10,000 \u2013 $150 = $9,850. The price of the Treasury bill is $9,850. You buy the T-bill at the discounted price, and then the government pays you the face value at maturity. The difference between the discount price and the par amount (face value) is interest.Calculate the interest rate to determine if it is competitive with other possible investments. Divide the interest you will earn by the actual cash price you paid. Using the above example: $150 / $9,850 = 0.015 = 1.5 percent interest."}
{"title": "How Does High-Frequency Trading Work?", "text": "High-frequency trading -- sometimes also called \"algorithmic trading,\" \"algo trading\" and \"black box trading\" -- refers to an extremely active trading strategy in which investors buy and sell stocks, commodities, currencies, options or other securities very frequently. The goal is to take advantage of very short-term fluctuations in asset prices -- sometimes lasting for just minutes or seconds -- before trading out of them.Algorithmic traders program computers to buy and sell securities automatically when certain market conditions are met. The computer then executes the trade progammed -- buying and selling at the appropriate points -- with little or no prompting or interaction with the investor. The theoretical advantage to algorithmic trading is that it takes the emotions out of the investing process. Further, once the programming is done, the investor does not need to continue to micromanage his portfolio. The computer, in theory, does that for him.Whether the investor uses an algorithmic approach to trading or makes frequent trades manually, he typically uses specialized day-trading software that helps track the performance, pricing and volume data on his selected securities and indexes. The software connects him automatically with one or more broker/dealers, or stock brokerages, that handle the buying, selling and record-keeping on the investor's behalf.The high-frequency trader must concern himself with several costs, in order to function and survive as a trader. The first is the costs of the technology, meaning the software and computer equipment needed. The second is transaction costs -- principally the commissions charged by the brokerage company. There is another cost -- called the bid/ask spread -- that is hidden from the investor. This is the difference between the price a brokerage obtains a security for and the price it charges the buyer. With small or illiquid stocks, this bid/ask spread can be significant. Lastly is taxation. In the U.S., the investor must pay a capital gains tax on all profitable trades, unless the trade is canceled out by an unprofitable one. Short-term gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains. If the investor is conducting his investing as a business, then he is subject to income tax, rather than capital gains tax, on profits.The Securities Exchange Commission subjects those making a living as high-frequency traders, or day traders, to certain special regulations. For example, day traders must keep a minimum of $25,000 in their trading accounts at all times. Day traders must also comply with strict margin rules on accounts in which they plan to trade with money borrowed from their broker. Further, if the IRS deems that the trader is doing short-term trading as a business, then any profits will generally be treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gains, for tax purposes."}
{"title": "How to Find Earnings Available for Common Stockholders", "text": "Every year, publicly-held companies must release financial information so that investors can make informed decisions about whether or not to invest. As part of these disclosures, the company must release an income statement, showing the company's income and expenditure breakdown. From this information, you can calculate the earnings available to common stockholders. This metric measures how much profit the company generates per share after all expenses have been accounted for, including preferred dividends.Subtract the company's total expenses from its total revenues to find the company's total earnings for the year. For example, if the company has $3.6 million in revenues and $3.1 million in expenses, the company has $500,000 in earnings.Multiply the dividends per preferred share by the number of preferred shares outstanding to find the company's total preferred dividends paid. For example, if the company has 15,000 preferred shares and pays $1.91 per share, multiply 15,000 by $1.91 to find the company paid out $28,650 in preferred stock dividends.Subtract the preferred stock dividends from the company's net earnings to find the earnings available for common stockholders. Finishing this example, subtract $28,650 from $500,000 to find the company's earnings available for common stockholders equals $471,350."}
{"title": "Understanding Credit Card Purchase, Price and Warranty Protections", "text": "If you\u2019re like most people, you spend a lot more money \u2014 especially on presents, travel and food \u2014 between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s than at other times of the year. The shopping environment itself is different too, from Black Friday door buster deals to post-Christmas clearance sales.\n>>More: How to Maximize Credit Card Rewards When Shopping\nThat\u2019s why the holidays are a great time to familiarize yourself with the protections that your credit cards offer you all year round. These benefits could ensure that you pay the lowest price for a gift, receive a replacement for a broken toy or get an extended warranty on the latest must-have gadget.\nHere\u2019s what you should look for.\nPrice protection\nIt can be maddening to buy something at full price, or even on sale, and then see the same item elsewhere at a considerably lower price. Some credit cards offer a way out of that bind with price protection, a benefit that allows you to recover the difference if you find a lower price for the same item.\nWant to know more? Check out our overview of credit cards that offer price protection.\nReturn protection\nChoosing gifts is an inexact science. It\u2019s easy to buy your loved ones the wrong size or an item they already have. Credit cards that offer return protection often extend the amount of time you have to return an item, or allow you to recoup your money if the store has no return policy.\nIntrigued? We\u2019ve broken down which credit cards offer return protection.\nPurchase protection\nNormally, if something you\u2019ve bought is damaged or stolen, your only recourse is to file a claim with your homeowners or renters insurance policy. But such policies often have high deductibles that may be more than the item is worth. That\u2019s why credit cards that offer coverage for broken or lost purchases can be a relief. If your purchase is stolen or damaged for a covered reason, you could be reimbursed the cost of the item, even if it was a gift.\nWondering if you\u2019re covered? We\u2019ve got details on which credit cards offer purchase protection.\nWarranty extension\nExtended warranties are pricey if you pay for them at the cash register. But sometimes they\u2019re indispensible, like when you\u2019re buying your child\u2019s first laptop or buying a product that doesn\u2019t tend to last very long. If you\u2019re using a credit card that automatically extends the warranty on whatever you buy, you may not have to pay a separate charge. Your purchase\u2019s warranty can be extended for up to a year.\nWant a credit card that offers extended warranties? We\u2019ve got all the details.\nThe takeaway\nUsing a credit card for holiday shopping can be a win-win. Not only can you earn rewards and give yourself a few weeks of breathing room to pay for your purchases, you can also gain more protection for your purchases.\nIf your existing cards don\u2019t come with the safeguards you need to protect your holiday purchases, it may be time to go shopping for a new credit card before you go shopping for stocking stuffers and Hanukkah gifts."}

This advantage allows online retailers to expand their market to global proportions or target an extremely focused segment.While the small retail store on Main Street may never dream of competing with a national chain retailer, it may find itself on a more level playing field with its competitors through the addition of online sales.People can find your brand and interact with it when you have an online presence. You reach many new potential customers. Much of online traffic is organic, meaning that if you build your online store correctly, customers will find you without spending a dime. Traditional advertising can offer great headlines and ad copy, but advertising is costly. Why not try to benefit from online searches your customers are already making? Disadvantages of Selling OnlineOne of the biggest disadvantages of selling online is the continued battle with security. Shoppers are becoming more relaxed with providing their personal and credit card information, but security concerns are still keeping many consumers offline.Retailers that sell online only may have to work harder to build trust and a relationship with their customers. Personal interaction is limited with selling online and there is plenty of competition. Store owners may find it very difficult to keep shoppers coming back.As online retailers expand their customer base to include shoppers in other countries, they also increase the difficulties in delivering their goods. The shipping process takes control from the retailer, but leaves the burden on his/her shoulders. If the customer does not receive their products immediately, it is ultimately the retailer's responsibility to resolve the issue.The Importance of Omni-Channel RetailRetailers who sell online are dealing with a very different animal than traditional brick and mortar stores. The transition online is not as easy as you may think. But there is a growing emphasis placed on what is known as omni-channel retail, which refers to retailers who sell in multiple \"channels.\" Today, a retailer might have an online store, a traditional brick and mortar store, and perhaps even a mail order or catalogue business. No matter how many channels you sell in, the customer experience needs to be equal; otherwise, you are setting yourself up for disaster. Your brand must be consistent among all channels. The bottom line is that while some would have you to believe that brick and mortar retail is dead, nothing could be further from the truth. Even with the growth and prominence of e-commerce, consumers continue to frequent brick and mortar storefronts, and this doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon. E-commerce and traditional storefront retail will continue to grow together, for better or worse."}
{"title": "How to Connect With Your Customers Using Newsletters", "text": "A newsletter is one of the best ways to keep your name in front of the eyes of your clients, your associates, and others that may be in your target market. A newsletter allows you to show them that you are more than just someone who is looking for projects to work on. And a newsletter shows that you are willing to pass on information that will help them run their own businesses. Newsletters are also a good complement to other forms of internet marketing such as emails, business websites, blogging, social media, etc.Think about how many newsletters you read each week or month. Do you enjoy getting and reading them? Do you find the articles and other information in them helpful? Do you know who or what company produces them? Of course, you do! Here are tips on how to create a newsletter for your small business.Newsletter FormatsNewsletters can be produced in several formats. For businesses, the most economical and most readily acceptable newsletter formats are plain text emails, HTML emails, HTML pages on your website, PDFs, and printed documents. Each newsletter format has its own advantages and disadvantages. (See the table below.)Deciding which newsletter format to use and how frequently you publish your newsletter may be a process of trial and error. For instance, many years ago our newsletter started as a monthly text only email. This only took about two hours a month to put together.As time went on, plain text was no longer sufficient - users expected to see images, graphics, and even video in a newsletter. So we tried an HTML newsletter design. These newsletters turned out very visually appealing but seemed to take a long time to produce, about 4-5 hours each month.But it still didn't seem to be exactly what our readers or we fully enjoyed reading. Our current newsletter format is PDF and feedback has shown that everyone loves the new format, which can be read on a desktop or mobile devices. It does take quite a bit of time to produce but, when you enjoy being creative, it doesn't seem all that bad. We use MS Publisher to design the newsletter and save it in PDF format. You can also create PDF documents from MS Word or from other newsletter creation tools such as Adobe InDesign.Newsletter Format Pros and ConsFormatProsConsPlain Text Emaileasy to formatObsolete - limited to text only - can't include graphics or fancy formatting Does not require expensive software HTML EmailVisually appealingRestricted in size Allows for creativenessCan only be fully viewed while reader is onlineHTML Web PageEndless possibilities for designTakes time to design Room for lots of content & graphicsReader has to be online to view Can be as big as you like  Don't need to send as email attachment PDFEndless possibilities for designThe larger the format, the longer to produce Room for lots of content & graphicsNeed to have an application that can generate PDF content (or a conversion program) Can be as big as you like  Can send only a text email with a link to the page  Readers can save to their computer and read at their leisure PrintEndless possibilities for designCostly to print and mail Room for lots of content & graphics  Can be as big as you like Newsletter Content Many people considering creating a newsletter for their small business ask what newsletter content should be included. Again, your target audience will be the main factor that will determine what you want to include.But no matter who your audience is, be sure to make your newsletter content timely. If a world event may affect your industry, be sure to include newsletter content that shows the various possible points of view.Another question that many readers (and prospective newsletter editors) ask is, \"where do you find your newsletter content?\" Actually, most of the content in my newsletter finds me. I do write newsletter content myself but also include information from other writers and sources.Once you start publishing a newsletter, in addition to posting it on your website or emailing it to your customer list you can also submit it to Ezine directories. Most of these directories will ask you if you accept newsletter content. By answering yes, writers will submit their articles for your newsletter.BestEzines.com allows you to submit your newsletter or ezine by category and have it reviewed by visitors.Another way of finding newsletter content is to read other newsletters and blogs that are similar to yours or that target similar markets. If you spot a particular article, blog or other newsletter content that you would like to use, contact the newsletter editor or the author of the article and ask to use it before you go ahead and include it in your newsletter. Editors will appreciate that you are actually reading their newsletter content and authors usually like to have copies of publications that their articles appear in and may request a copy or subscribe to your newsletter.Once you have approached an author, you will probably be added to their mailing list and they will send you future articles that are appropriate for your newsletter.You can also pick up articles from various websites that collect articles strictly for the purpose of offering them as newsletter content. An example is EZineArticles.com.Other ideas for possible content for your newsletter are:special dates for the month,jokes or limericks (be sure they are not offensive),helpful links and tips,crossword or word search puzzles, testimonials,profiles of your clients or contacts,book reviews,upcoming events in your industry (trade shows, etc.),and of course, information about what your business offers.Some of the above suggestions for newsletter content will come to you through emails, blogs, or just surfing the 'Net. Be sure to set aside a folder in your email program and an area in your Favorites list in your browser for anything that may seem like good newsletter content.Whether or not you choose to include advertising in your newsletter is your own choice but don't overdo it. It is a way to make a few bucks to offset your time but ask yourself one question, \"How much advertising do I like to see in a newsletter?\"Also, learn by example. What is it about other newsletters that you receive that you like and dislike? Just remember to think about your readers when deciding what to include in your newsletter. Ask them for feedback and what they would like to see included in upcoming issues. Producing a successful newsletter is not all that difficult but you must be sure to make time to do it on a regular basis.Newsletter PromotionThe next step in the success of your newsletter is promoting it. The following are just a few suggestions:Include your article archives on your website and be sure to have a sign-up email address form for your visitors.Put a link to your newsletter in the signature lines you use in your emails.If you write articles, be sure to add a short sentence about your newsletter in the contact information that you include at the end.Invite your newsletter readers to pass on each and every issue of your newsletter to their friends and associates.If allowed, announce that the current issue of your newsletter is available on any email discussion lists that you are on. Don't include the newsletter, just include instructions on how people can get it and how they can sign up to receive it automatically.Exchange ads or information with other newsletter publishers.Be sure to submit your newsletter to various submission sites such as the ones I've mentioned above.No matter how you choose to format your newsletter or what you choose to include in it, newsletters are one of the best ways to showcase your business, build credibility as an expert in your field, and stay in touch with your contacts.See also:10 Low-Cost Ways to Promote Your BusinessHow to Create a Social Media Plan10 Ways to Get Positive Word of Mouth for Your Business6 Ways of Marketing Online"}

{"title": "How to Save $1,000 by 2017", "text": "Would you like a thousand more dollars in your bank account by 2017? And not just in there temporarily, like that one day in between pay day and paying the rent when you feel richer than you really are, but $1,000 that you have actually saved?\n\nIt might sound impossible. After all, saving $1,000 in the best two months is difficult, but saving $1,000 during the holidays, when you have parties to go to and presents to buy and family and friends to visit, can sound like pure fiction. But here's the thing: You can do it. It's not easy, but you can do it, and here's how.\n\nDitch your gym membership\n\nSavings: $58/month\n\nAccording to Cheat Sheet, the average cost of a monthly gym membership is $58. Go to your gym today and cancel. Don't worry: You can sign up again in January, when your gym (or others in the area) will be offering discounted signup rates to compete for the business of all the New Year's Resolutioners.\n\nIn the meantime, take the next two months as a chance to try out different gyms and classes in your area. Most gyms and many classes offer free days or even weeks to give prospective members and students a chance to get a feel for the establishment. Make a list of all the fitness clubs and classes you've been dying to try and start testing them out. Who knows, you might even find your 2017 fitness obsession in the process.\n\nSkip your daily cup of coffee\n\nSavings: $60/month\n\nYes, we've all heard this one before, but it's a cliche because it works. If you have a regular Starbucks habit, chances are you're spending about $3 per day on your caffeine fix, according to numbers reported by Square. If you go five days a week, that's $15 a week, which adds up to $60 per month and a whopping $120 by 2017.\n\nSo take a deep breath, delete the Starbucks app from your phone and commit to grabbing a cup at the (probably free) office Keurig instead.\n\nStop going out for lunch\n\nSavings: $80/month\n\nYes, lunch desks feel sad and yes, sometimes even just leaving to pick up food to bring back to the office for a sad lunch desk is the only time you see the actual sun (and that could be for the whole day now that we're deep into Daylight Saving Time and we've already canceled your daily coffee run in the name of saving money), but skip lunch out with coworkers. Skip it every single day until 2017 because there are massive savings to be had.\n\nAccording to Life in Charge, the cost of eating lunch out during the workweek is $160 per month (assuming an average of $8 per meal, which could be significantly higher in some cities). The cost of bringing lunch from home? Anywhere from $2-5 per day. If assume an average of $4/day for your sack lunch, that's $80 in savings every single month.\n\nStop going out for dinner, too (at least sometimes)\n\nSavings: $51/month\n\nSince you've already gotten into the habit of making lunches at home, why not go the extra mile and make a few more dinners at home, too? We don't expect you to give up eating out entirely, but just cutting one dinner out per week can have a huge impact on your savings.\n\nAccording to The Simple Dollar, the average American eats 18.2 meals outside of the home every month and the average cost per meal out is $12.75 per person. By cutting just one extra dinner out per week, you can save an additional $51 per month (more, if you're spending more than $12.75 when you go out to eat).\n\nTurn the heat down\n\nSavings: $10/month\n\nAs the weather gets colder, you're probably turning up the heat in your house or apartment pretty regularly, but if you're willing to try bundling up instead of turning up, you could be in for some savings.\n\nPersonal finance blog I Will Teach You to Be Rich spoke to Bill Prindle, deputy director for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy about saving money on heating bills and they report that you can save 10 percent on your bill for every 3-4 degrees lower you set the thermostat in the winter. If your electric bill averages $100/month in the winter, that means you'll end up saving about $10 per month.\n\nUnplug alllll of your appliances\n\nSavings: $8/month\n\nThere are obvious things you can do to minimize your electric bill, like turning off the lights and TV when you leave the room. But if you're willing to go above and beyond and literally unplug all of your appliances when they're not in use, in addition to being very busy unplugging things, you could be richer for your efforts. The Nest reports that doing this could save you about $100 per year, which works out to a little over $8 per month.\n\nReplace one night out a month with a night in\n\nSavings: At least $25/month\n\nIf you like to go out with friends, you are a normal adult human. If you tend to spend more than you'd like when you do, you're also a normal adult human. Estimating $25 per night out is probably pretty conservative (in many places, that's just two drinks, and doesn't even touch food, tip, and the Uber home). Replace one night out per month with a night in instead. Offer to host at your place and ask guests to each bring a bottle or a snack with the promise that you'll provide the Netflix and a couch to crash on, if needed. It's just as fun and basically free.\n\nRethink your approach to holiday gifts\n\nSavings: $362-755\n\nThe holidays make it a difficult time to save money, but they also represent a huge avenue for saving on a November/December time crunch. According to Elle Decor, the average shopper spends $830 during the holidays. Yes. $830, as in almost $1,000 JUST IN HOLIDAY GIFT SPENDING ALONE. But don't worry because it's actually super easy to cut that number wayyyy down if you know where to look.\n\nFirst, you can save $131 right away by committing not to spend on any money on presents for yourself while you're shopping for everyone else. That's the average amount that people spend to treat themselves while they're supposed to be shopping for friends and family. Yikes \u2014 that's a huge number, but it's also a huge place to save now that you know how costly it is.\n\nNext, save another $231 by making half of the gifts you give your family. If you're crafty and have the necessary supplies on hand, make something that will give your sister Pinterest Envy. If you're a great baker, make your mom cookies just like your grandma used to make. If you don't have the skills or the resources to make physical gifts, go really old school and gift your relatives with coupons for services you can complete (like free nights of babysitting or lawn care services for when the snow melts away).\n\nAccording to Elle Decor, the average shopper spends $462 on family members alone. And since your family will love you (and your gifts) no matter what, it's a perfect chance to save money and show them just how thoughtful you can be.\n\nFinally, as a bonus, if you have a significant other, you have a chance to save even more. The same Elle Decor article reports that couples spend oodles on each other to show their love around the holidays. New couples spend about $93 on their partners, while couples who have been together for 10 years report spending as much as $300 on one another. Not only is that a TON of money, it's also probably not the most effective way to show your love. Talk to your S.O. about foregoing monetary gifts and committing to do something thoughtful for each other or find a low-cost way to bond with each other (like by spending a day volunteering together for a cause you both love) instead.\n\nTotal saved in two months: $946-1,339"}

{"title": "Tips for getting the sweepstakes advantage", "text": "Dreaming of winning big? Try sweepstaking\nThose who win luxury cars, fabulous trips, big-screen televisions and laptops \u2014 they\u2019re the luckiest people in the world, right? Nope. They\u2019ll be the first ones to admit luck has little to do with the truckloads of loot frequent contest winners lug home. For these diehards, and others who make entering contests and sweepstakes a full-time hobby, winning means working at it. They even hold sweepstakes conventions where they trade tips for success. Here\u2019s a look at how some people \u2014 who call themselves \u201csweepers\u201d \u2014 take home more than their fair share of the loot.\nTo win, first you have to enter Almost everyone\u2019s thrown his or her name in the hat to win a prize, and almost everyone\u2019s won something, even if it\u2019s as simple as a cake at a cakewalk. But the first rule of winning is entering \u2014 and entering more than one contest. Frequent winners devote lots of time to their hobby. Connecticut resident Wendy \u201cSweetie\u201d Limauge, who\u2019s won a truck and luxury trips, says she came to sweepstaking from couponing. Limauge first learned about the science of entering contests at a 1996 monthly coupon swap at a local library. \u201cI started entering right away and won my first prize within weeks,\u201d says Limauge. Although many sweepers devote hours to finding and entering contests, Limauge says she usually spends about an hour a day on contest entries. On busier days, that might be whittled down to as little as 15 minutes, but what really counts is making entering a daily habit.\nIncrease your chances \u2014 get organized Maybe you\u2019re an Internet whiz and so organized that even your pantry\u2019s alphabetized. But sweepers who win the most say they leave little to chance, instead relying on chat rooms, newsletters and websites to help them determine which contests and sweepstakes are worth their time. Patti Osterheld began as a subscriber to SweepSheet.com, one of the oldest and most respected newsletters for sweepers, and ended up as its editor. Osterheld says the key to winning is to let someone else do all of the digging and drudge work for you. \u201cThere are about 800 to 1,000 new sweepstakes released each month; nobody has time to keep up with those,\u201d Osterheld says. She recommends subscribing to a good newsletter and checking out reputable sweepstakes websites for information. Osterheld says SweepSheet has a staff of 10 who spend their workdays finding sweepstakes and verifying they\u2019re legitimate.\nNot all sweepstakes are for real As Osterheld notes, the sweepstakes world, like the rest of cyberspace, has been overrun with con artists out to make a quick and dishonest buck. It\u2019s important to make sure sweepstakes are on the up-and-up. One way to avoid sweepstakes scams is to ignore all of those emails you get that say you\u2019ve won $1 million or more in a sweepstakes. Few ever have that kind of prize money. Osterheld says she has only seen about five $1 million-or-more sweepstakes in her entire career. One big sweepstakes that\u2019s on the up-and-up is Publishers Clearing House. If you decide to try your luck in the PCH sweepstakes, keep in mind your chance of winning the $10 million prize is tiny at best. Although odds of winning are determined by how many entries a sweepstakes receives, one expert says the average PCH entry has about a 1 in 505 million chance of winning. The expert adds if you do decide to play the odds, you increase your chances with multiple entries scattered over a period of time.\nYou\u2019ve won! How to vet a contest Osterheld offers this checklist for making sure a contest or notification is the real deal: You can\u2019t win something you didn\u2019t enter. If you receive notification that you won and you don\u2019t remember entering, delete it.\nYou should never have to pay to receive a prize.\nReal corporations don\u2019t run their own contests. They use judging agencies such as ePrize. If there\u2019s no judging agency associated with the win, be suspicious.\nSome contest ads are fronts for uploading viruses onto your computer. Be especially careful clicking on banner ads. Even better, let a newsletter company check out and verify a contest\u2019s legitimacy.\nAny contest you have to pay to enter is not legitimate.\nKnow where to look At the heart of the art of winning is the equally important art of knowing where to look for opportunities \u2014 and they\u2019re not all on the Internet. In addition to searching online for contests and sweepstakes, don\u2019t forget about grocery stores. Often, manufacturers will tout sweepstakes on the wrappings of their products or on large product displays. Many consumers will ignore the items on the top and bottom shelves of stores, but sweepers say to look high and low for contests casual shoppers might miss. And the good news is the law says you don\u2019t have to purchase an item to enter. Another great place to look for opportunities: blogs. Bloggers often have small and large giveaways there for the taking. And many blog-centric contests draw few entries, so your chances are even better. GoodBadAndFab.com, PursePixie.com and FamilyFocusblog.com are a few blogs that regularly run contests and giveaways.\nMine social media sites Work-at-home mom and sweeper Linsey Knerl of Tekamah, Neb., says she finds great contests through Facebook and Twitter. Knerl, who started sweepstaking when her now-13-year-old daughter was born, has won concert tickets, spa treatments, iPods and, most recently, a giant-screen LED TV. She won that last item through a contest posted on Facebook, but she says a lot of them are only open to fans of a company\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cI\u2019d opt out of the company\u2019s newsletter, though, just to keep the clutter in your inbox down,\u201d says Knerl. And, while Knerl says many online sweepstakes sites and newsletters are valuable, she\u2019d avoid books on the subject, not only because the information is already free on the Internet, but because the field changes so rapidly.\nPlay by the rules All of the experts agree: Don\u2019t enter if you\u2019re not really eligible. They say to read the rules carefully. Don\u2019t simply fill out the form and hit \u201center.\u201d If the rules call for you to be in the military, fit a certain demographic or be at least 21 years of age, then don\u2019t fudge. Even if you do win, you won\u2019t be able to accept the prize and you\u2019ll forfeit. One shortcut many experienced sweepers use is a good auto-fill program on their computers. For those who enter tons of online contests, auto-fill drastically reduces their entry time, allowing them to enter a dozen contests in the time it takes the average person to enter one. But beware: Some contests specifically ban the use of auto-fill.\nDon\u2019t sweat the taxes Lots of people won\u2019t bother to enter contests because they think taxes will wipe them out. While winning millions could certainly require some hefty taxes (though coming out of hefty winnings), winners say not to sweat it: Winnings count as taxable income, but they are not subject to Social Security and other withholdings. Paying taxes on her winnings certainly hasn\u2019t discouraged Osterheld from sweeping. Among the prizes she\u2019s racked up are tons of trips and opportunities such as riding in the pace car at a NASCAR event, throwing out the first pitch at a Cubs game and playing golf with the pros. The strangest prize she\u2019s come across in her career? \u201cA couple of years ago, there was a trip to New York to have a colonoscopy,\u201d says Osterheld."}
{"title": "What Is the Maximum Contribution for a 401k?", "text": "A 401k plan serves as the primary source of retirement savings for many people. Employees can elect to have a portion of their wages contributed to their 401k plan on a pre-tax basis. These contributions are also called elective deferrals. Employers sometimes match a percentage of the employee's 401k contributions as an employment benefit. Tax is deferred on 401k plans until the money is withdrawn.\n\nA 401k can be a substantial part of a retirement nest egg.\n\ncredit: Francesco Ridolfi/iStock/Getty Images\n\nTypes of 401k Plans\n\nSome employers will match contributions to a 401k.\n\ncredit: Catherine Yeulet/iStock/Getty Images\n\nMost people with a 401k have a traditional plan. Under traditional 401k rules, employers must meet specific nondiscrimination requirements, and employees may be subject to a vesting schedule for employer contributions. In a safe harbor 401k plan, employees immediately become fully vested in employer contributions, and employers avoid the nondiscrimination requirements of traditional 401k plans. A SIMPLE 401k caters to small businesses--those with 100 or fewer employees. As with the safe harbor 401k, employees immediately become fully invested in employer contributions. SIMPLE is an acronym for savings incentive match plan for employees.\n\n401k Contribution Maximums\n\nThere are limitations to the amount of wages an individual can contribute to their 401k plan.\n\ncredit: darren baker/iStock/Getty Images\n\nLimitations exist on the amount of wages an employee can contribute to a 401k plan. For 2010 and 2011, the Internal Revenue Code limits elective deferrals to $16,500 for traditional and safe harbor 401k plans, and to $11,500 for SIMPLE 401k plans. The individual 401k plan might impose other limits, such as a certain percentage of income, that could result in a lower contribution maximum. A plan may permit catch-up contributions for employees age 50 and over; the 2010 and 2011 maximum additional catch-up contribution is $5,500 for traditional and safe harbor 401k plans, and $2,500 for SIMPLE 401k plans.

{"title": "How You Can Defeat Propaganda", "text": "Since this is a website available around the world, it is appropriate to talk about how to combat propaganda that has the full weight and power of the state behind it -- because there are still places on this earth where that's happening.The more common public relations challenge is combating propaganda on a smaller scale, whether it's a political campaign, a corporate battle or a non-profit trying to generate awareness of an issue in the face of a government covering up the evidence.It's hard to fight fire with fire, especially when you (a) can't use the same evil techniques, manipulations and lies as the other side and (b) are typically David in a fight against Goliath since propaganda is a tool of those in power and on top.1) Using Leaks to Undermine PropagandaThe greatest strength of a propaganda campaign is also its greatest weakness.An organized and well-funded propaganda campaign involves a lot of people communicating with each other, holding meetings, writing documents, making plans and sending e-mails.It's harder and harder to keep a secret these days. A single leaked e-mail can expose a propaganda effort as a fraud and a lie.Some experts are now predicting that this problem is impossible to solve and that the Wikileaks scandals mean the age of big, top-down organizations is over. Only smaller, self-contained teams will be able to control sensitive information and not get leaked to death.If you're in a fight against propaganda, getting this sort of evidence from the inside is crucial to undermining the motives and credibility of the other side. This will help level the field.2) Subverting propagandaThe other tactic you must use is rhetorical jujitsu. Don't try to fight imagery with imagery and slogans with slogans. If you're the underdog, you're going to get outgunned, and they're fighting dirty while you're fighting fair. You'll lose that kind of battle.Take all the time, money and effort they're spending on images, slogans, and messages and use it against the propagandist by subverting those images, slogans, and messages.During the Cold War, and even today in totalitarian regimes, you'll see this with clever graffiti artists defacing posters to undermine and reverse the intended message of the propaganda.3) Create your own ways to communicateThe last tactic is to establish your own channels of communication, especially if the other side dominates -- or controls -- the mainstream media.Social media, blogs and e-mail can let you communicate directly to the people and the press, and that's vital in a fight against propaganda."}

{"title": "Pension Benefits for Widows", "text": "Widows \u2013 and widowers \u2013 can find themselves grappling with grief at the same time they must deal with the sudden loss of their spouses' incomes. The federal government recognizes this and requires private pension plans to provide benefits to survivors under the terms of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Other types of pensions and benefits offer some survivor benefits as well.\n\nPrivate Pensions\n\nThe rules for private pensions can depend on the type of plan, but some general rules apply. You and your spouse either elected to receive pension payments with survivor benefits, or you waived this right. Pension payments would have been less during his lifetime if you chose the option of survivor benefits, but you will continue to receive those payments after his death for the rest of your life if that's the option you chose. They won't be as much as they were during his lifetime, however -- you may receive as little as half. With most plans, you must have been married for at least a year in order to collect, but you won't lose benefits if you remarry.\n\nU.S. Civil Service Retirement\n\nU.S. Civil Service Retirement survivor benefits have rules similar to those of private pensions if your spouse dies after he begins collecting benefits. You also can receive benefits if your spouse was still working for the government at the time of his death, but you must have been married for at least one year or be the parent of his child. He must have worked for the government for a minimum of 18 months. Unfortunately, you won't receive ongoing benefits if he's not working at the time of his death but hasn't yet begun to collect his retirement benefits. You may receive a lump sum, however, equal to the contributions he made while working. If you find yourself in this situation, speak with a financial planner so you're sure of your rights.\n\nMilitary and Veterans Benefits\n\nIf your spouse served in the military, you may be able to collect survivors benefits. The VA's Survivors Pension benefit pays you tax-free income if you haven't remarried. Your spouse must have served at least 24 months active duty with at least one day occurring during wartime, or the full term of his call to active duty with one day during wartime, if he served after September 7, 1980. If he served before this date, he must have had at least 90 days active duty with at least one day during wartime. These benefits are provided only to low-income survivors, however, and they're only available if your spouse was discharged honorably.\n\nSocial Security Benefits\n\nAlthough Social Security retirement benefits aren't actually a pension, they can help you make ends meet. If your spouse retired at or after age 65 and you're at least 65, you can collect either 100 percent of your spouse's benefits or your own, whichever is greater. If you're at least 60 years old, you can receive 71.5 percent of his benefits. You must have been married for a minimum of nine months before his death unless you have a child together \u2013 either biological or adopted \u2013 or he died as the result of a job-related incident.

{"title": "What Is Mobile Home Insurance?", "text": "If you own a house, you should have homeowners insurance to cover both the loss of your house and it contents. The same holds true for someone who owns a mobile home. Mobile home insurance can help protect your valuable assets, and much more.\n\nWhat Is Mobile Home Insurance?\n\nYour Mobile Home\n\nA mobile home insurance policy will either replace or pay for damages resulting from such things as fire, lightening, hail or any other disaster not excluded from the terms of the policy. In addition to covering damages to the mobile home, many policies also will pay for losses to other structures attached to the mobile home, such as patios and garages. Many policies limit the company's liability to $100,000, but additional coverage can be purchased.\n\nPlantings\n\nIf you must replace trees or shrubs next to your mobile home that are damaged or are stolen, most mobile home insurance policies will cover the cost of replacing them, to the extent of the limits set by your policy.\n\nPersonal Items\n\nIf items such as furniture, clothing or other personal property have either been stolen or destroyed, your mobile home insurance will cover the loss up to the amount stated in your policy. You should take an inventory of those items and calculate the amount you would need to replace them. You might need to add to your coverage.\n\nLiabilities\n\nYour mobile home insurance policy will cover damage or loss to others and their property, regardless of whether you are at home or away, or if such a loss takes place away from your mobile home. That coverage extends to your pets, as well. For example, if your dog ruins a rug in a neighbor's house, your mobile home insurance will cover it. Most policies limit coverage to only those losses that are not covered by your automobile insurance. That coverage begins at $100,000 but you can increase it for about $20 per year for each additional $100,000.\n\nAdd To Your Coverage\n\nYou can add additional insurance. For example, if you must move temporarily while your mobile home is being repaired, you can be covered for those expenses. Also, for an additional premium, you can be covered for any legal and other fees arising from losses either to your mobile home and your property, as well as to others and their property."}
{"title": "What is a Quota?", "text": "Definition:A quota, or sales goal, is a set amount of selling that a salesperson is expected to meet over a given time frame. Nearly all companies set quotas for their salespeople, as a quota both ensures that a salesperson knows what is expected of him and is the easiest way to determine what commissions are due for that salesperson.While quotas are widespread in the sales industry, the form they take can vary quite a bit from company to company. A small business with a handful of salespeople and one or two products to sell will probably set a very simple quota \u2013 for example, the goal might be for each salesperson to sell $100,000 worth of products per calendar quarter. On the other hand, a large company with thousands of sales reps and many different products or services may set a very complex quota consisting of different targets for different products \u2013 100 units of product A, 50 units of service B, $1,000 worth of add-on services such as warranties, and so on. In the case of a large company with offices spread out over a wide geographic area, goals for each office will probably differ based on their perceived potential. In other words, an office that traditionally makes a lot of sales and has lots of market potential will have higher goals for its salespeople than one in an area with few potential customers.Quotas may be set for time periods ranging from weekly to yearly, but quarterly quotas are probably the most common. A quarterly period gives salespeople plenty of time to align their sales strategies to their goals and set a sales plan in motion. Quarterly quotas also help companies take product seasonality into consideration. If a particular product sells much better in summer than in winter, then the company can have a higher quota in Q3 than it does in Q4 and make more revenue without putting too much strain on the sales team.Sales executives will usually set quotas based on historical data combined with their projections of how their industry will do in the near future. Unfortunately, even the best forecasting models can turn out to be far off from reality, especially when the marketplace goes through sudden and unexpected changes. For example, if a specific industry is rocked by a scandal or if technology makes a particular product obsolete, then the salespeople are not going to have much of a chance of meeting quotas that did not take those factors into consideration. In these cases, sales managers would be advised to adjust their commissions payouts to relieve some of the sales team's pain, assuming that the salespeople clearly put in their best efforts.Commissions are usually tied to quotas in some fashion. Sometimes it's a simple correlation, such as a commissions structure that pays out 5% for every unit sold under quota and 10% after the salesperson meets his quota. In other cases, companies might set up commissions based on complicated mathematical calculations that factor in the salesperson's performance in selling many different products. Generally speaking, tying sales commissions to the amount of revenue that a salesperson brings in is a good way to fairly compensate the salesperson while keeping that compensation in line with how much money the company made from his efforts.As a rule of thumb, many sales experts say that a quota is fair if about 80% of the salespeople can meet it during most quota periods. If less than 80% of the sales team is meeting quota most of the time, the numbers should be adjusted down in the future \u2013 but if the entire team always meets or exceeds their quota, then they aren't being challenged enough."}
{"title": "What Does a No-Fault Attendance System Look Like?", "text": "Tracking your employee's attendance is important to your company's bottom line. Attendance is defined, quite simply, as showing up for work, but how can you track it? By implementing well-defined policies and a tracking system.Especially with hourly or nonexempt employees, the attendance system clearly defines when employees are supposed to show up for work. This is especially important for nonexempt employees who frequently perform jobs that require a person to be there to serve customers.It is also important for those employees who work a function in an automated process that requires a worker at each workstation for the process to complete a product or service. It is for workers in these situations that attendance policies generally exist. You'll rarely find an attendance policy that addresses the work of exempt or salaried employees.Management and human resources departments will find that having an effective attendance policy in place creates a better work environment because employees know exactly what is expected of them.What is Workplace Attendance?Attendance is the act or fact of attending (being present at) work. Attendance is also used to define the number of persons present on a particular day at work. As mentioned, it most frequently refers to jobs of hourly paid employees.Attendance is also referred to as present at work or presenteeism.For example, an HR department may make notes like these in an employee's personnel file or in a company's assessment of its workplace challenges or goals.Rob had a wonderful work attendance record; he rarely missed a day from work.Mary has a challenge with attendance and arrives late to work at least two days a week.The attendance on first shift averaged only 75 percent on Mondays while employees recovered from their weekend fun. Obtaining qualified employees who want to work second shift with good attendance is challenging. Employees prefer to work days to have nights off or they prefer to work midnight shift so that they have days free. Second shift cuts across free time in both days and nights.What is an Attendance Policy?An attendance policy provides the guidelines and expectations for employee attendance at work as defined, written, disseminated, and implemented by an organization.Attendance policies exist most frequently for hourly or nonexempt employees for whom an organization must generally track hours and pay for overtime over 40 hours.Time at work record keeping is required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that governs the payment of overtime.Additionally, employees for whom attendance is tracked often perform jobs that are interdependent on other employees being in attendance. Such jobs include production line work in a manufacturing facility.An attendance policy is sometimes used interchangeably with an absenteeism policy. My view is that an attendance policy is much more narrowly defined and limited to attendance, as opposed to absenteeism policies which address absenteeism management issues and more.A Sample No-Fault Attendance SystemA No-Fault Point System is one example of an effective attendance policy. The goal is to reward good attendance and eliminate the employment of people with poor attendance. It uses a point system and does not excuse absences.This leaves managers and supervisors out of the role of judges, a role they hate to play. It places maximum accountability and responsibility for attendance on the employee which is where it ought to be.In a no-fault attendance system, absences are recorded similar to this:Each absence = 1 point (no multi-day occurrences)Each late-in (tardy) or early-out = 1/2 pointEach no-show for work = 2 pointsEach return with no prior call = 1 pointEach absence-free quarter eliminates all points and rewards the employee with a day off with pay.Each employee starts fresh, with no points, each year.Progressive disciplinary action accompanies a no-fault attendance system. If an employee earns so many points, they receive a warning that progressively worsens. A system like this allows both the employer and employee to know exactly what the consequences will be for poor attendance.7 points = verbal warning8 points = written warning9 points = 3 day suspension10 points = terminationHere is a detailed attendance policy to review. It includes rewards and penalties for hourly employee attendance."}
{"title": "Band of Investment Method to Determine Interest Rates", "text": "Band of investment (BOI) constitutes a financial method of calculating the capitalization rate, or cap rate, of a property. This method employs a handful of important figures, among them interest rates expected by investors in real-estate purchases. BOI employs assumed interest rates, percentage of invested capital and other figures when determining a cap rate. Although many financial sources rely on BOI as the preferred method of calculating cap rate, other sources decry its purported deficiencies.Cap rate, usually expressed as a percentage, constitutes a method of converting income earned from a property into an expression of capital value. Cap rate calculations sometimes involve simple math. In some instances, a cap rate equals nothing more than the Net Operating Income (NOI), or annual profit of a property, divided by its cost. For example, if a property cost $1 million with a NOI of $100,000, it maintains a cap rate of 10 percent, or 100,000/1,000,000 = .10. This means it earns 10 percent of its cost each year. The BOI method attempts to calculate the cap rate on a property for investors by considering equity and financing investments.Calculating a cap rate using the BOI method involves the use of interest rates on financing/mortgage investments and equity investments. Equity investments constitute the amount of an investment made in cash, while the mortgage component considers the value of a loan against the financed value of a property and the mortgage rate. Generic BOI calculations use standard interest rates on each component, generally assuming a return of about 10 percent on a mortgage investment, and 12 percent on an equity investment. These assumed rates go into calculating weighted rates of return, which lead to the cap rate on an investment. In real situations, accountants calculate cap rates using return percentages stipulated by contracts and mortgages.Calculating a cap rate using the BOI method entails the use of three mathematical processes, one for determining the weighted mortgage cap rate, one for determining the weighted equity cap rate, and another for determining the overall cap rate. Weighted cap rate equals portion of purchase capital x rate of return. For instance, assume an investment apportioned as 75 percent mortgage and 25 percent capital, and return of investment rates at 8 percent on mortgage and 12 percent on equity. The weighted mortgage cap rate equals six percent, or .75 x .08 = .06, and weighted equity mortgage cap rate equals three percent, or .25 x .02 = .03. Adding these cap rates gives the final cap rate via BOI, in this case 9 percent, or .03 + .06 = .09.Some people find serious deficiencies in the BOI method, due to the overall simplicity of its calculations. Some believe the financing/mortgage component of BOI makes erroneous assumptions, such as ignoring that mortgages last for a predetermined length of time, and aren't indefinite. The component is also criticized for ignoring differences between principal and interest. The equity rate, meanwhile, uses the equity yield rate, not internal rate of return or investor\u2019s rate or return, creating misleading figures. The Massachusetts Association of Assessing Officers points out that BOI also ignores taxes, which impact cap rates."}
{"title": "Bonds Payable Balance Sheet Classification", "text": "Long-term bonds help companies gain capital to finance their businesses. Investors purchase bonds, thus making a long-term loan to the company. After 10 or 20 years, the company must pay the investors back for their investment with interest. Company accountants list bonds payable as a long-term liability on the balance sheet.When a company sells bonds, it usually classifies the bond's value as a long-term liability. It lists the market price of bonds sold as a debit against cash and a credit to bonds payable. Then, when the bond matures, the company lists the payment of the principal as a debit against bonds payable, and a credit to cash.If a company offers bonds at a discounted price, it must record the amount of the discount as well as the value of the bonds. For example, if the market rate is 10 percent interest and the company issues bonds at 9 percent interest, the company lists the amount it gets for the bonds as a debit against cash. It lists the difference between the actual price and the discounted price as a debit against the discount on bonds payable, and lists the bond's total price as a credit to bonds payable.If bonds are issued at a discount, the discounted value of the bonds is called the carrying amount. Every year prior to maturity of the bond, the company lists the bond's value as a long term liability and a debit against bonds payable. However, the amount of the discount is listed and subtracted from the bonds payable. The new amount, which is equal to the carrying amount, is a credit to the discount on bonds payable.The company must also account for interest it pays bond holders who cash in their bonds. The company adds the total interest to the principal to determine the total cash paid out. It then subtracts the carrying amount, which is the amount investors paid to get the bonds, to determine its total interest expense. Most companies amortize, or spread out, the interest expense over the life of the bond."}

{"title": "How to Use Invoice Factoring for Your Business", "text": "As a small-business owner, you can turn your unpaid customer invoices into fast cash with invoice factoring and its closely related counterpart, invoice financing. It\u2019s best for business owners whose customers don\u2019t pay for goods or services until a later date but who need cash now to run their business.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about invoice factoring and invoice financing, plus some options on where to find financing.\nWhat is invoice factoring?\nTechnically, invoice factoring is not a loan. Rather, you sell your invoices at a discount to a factoring company in exchange for a lump sum of cash. The factoring company then owns the invoices and gets paid when it collects from your customers, typically in 30 to 90 days.\nLet\u2019s say you own a hardware store and sell goods to another business, creating a $10,000 invoice. Your customer agrees to pay off its invoices in 30 days, but you need the cash next week to pay your employees. You\u2019ve got a cash shortfall.\nYou could turn to a traditional bank for a loan, but it likely would require stellar personal credit plus collateral, a physical asset such as real estate that the lender could sell if you default. Or maybe you qualify but can\u2019t wait several months for the loan to close.\nSo you turn to an invoice factoring company, and it agrees to buy your invoice for $9,700 in cash \u2014 $10,000 minus a 3% factoring fee ($300). The invoice factoring company advances 85% (or $8,245) of the invoice within a few days. The factoring company then collects the invoice when it\u2019s due and provides the remaining balance owed to you ($1,455).\nInvoice factoring example\nInvoice value $10,000 Fee (3%) $300 Initial advance (85% of invoice value after fee) $8,245 Remaining advance (12%) $1,455 Total received $9,700\nThe factoring fee, also known as the discount rate, can run from 1% to 5%, depending on the invoice amount, your sales volume, your customer\u2019s creditworthiness and whether it\u2019s a recourse or nonrecourse factor. The factor type refers to who is ultimately responsible for an invoice that goes unpaid \u2014 your company or the factoring company.\nIf the contract is a recourse factor and the customer doesn\u2019t pay, you may have to buy back the unpaid receivable from the factoring company or replace it with a more current receivable of equal or greater value. If it\u2019s a nonrecourse factor, you\u2019re under no obligation to repay or replace the unpaid receivables, but you\u2019ll likely be charged a higher transaction fee because the factoring company takes on the added risk of not getting its money back.\n\n[Back to top]\nInvoice factoring pros and cons\nTHE PROS\nFast cash: Invoice factoring can provide immediate working capital to help cover a funding gap caused by slow-paying customers.\nInvoice factoring can provide immediate working capital to help cover a funding gap caused by slow-paying customers.

Easier approval: Invoice factoring provides financing to companies that might not be able to get capital from other sources, such as a traditional bank, because of a lack of collateral to back a loan, poor personal credit or a limited operating history. Typically, factoring companies care only about the value of the invoices you\u2019re looking to factor and the creditworthiness of your customers.\nTHE CONS\nHigh cost: The service can be expensive. You also have to watch out for hidden fees, such as application fees, processing fees for each invoice you finance, credit check fees or late fees if your client is past due on a payment. Late payments can trigger an increase in your annual percentage rate, the annual cost of borrowing money with all fees and interest included.\nThe service can be expensive.

{"title": "Elder Law - Addressing the Legal Needs of Our Aging Population", "text": "As baby boomers age and their parents live well into their 90s or even over 100, the field of elder law has continued to expand to meet the legal needs of this growing population. But what exactly is elder law, and why do you need to know about it?Definition of Elder LawIn its broadest sense, elder law is the specialized field of law that addresses the diverse legal needs of aging baby boomers and their elderly parents. This includes the following legal areas:Disability planning, including special needs planningLong term care planning, including Medicaid planning and veterans benefitsEstate planningGuardianship and conservatorshipEstate settlement, including probate and trust administrationElder abuse, both personal and financialBelow is an overview of each of these areas of elder law, which, as you can see, are quite diverse. This is why it will be important for you or your family to seek out the right type of elder law attorney when you or they need assistance with an elder law problem.Disability Planning and Special Needs PlanningMaking a plan for the possibility of becoming mentally incapacitated is a must, especially for baby boomers and their elderly parents. Why? Because without a disability plan, you and your assets will end up in a court-supervised guardianship, also called conservatorship in some states, which is discussed in more detail below. There are several legal documents that you need to have in place to protect you and your property from guardianship or conservatorship, including a Power of Attorney, an Advance Medical Directive and a Living Will. In addition, a Revocable Living Trust can be part of a comprehensive disability plan.Special needs planning encompasses the legal needs of disabled individuals, including both children and adults. In many cases, these individuals will be eligible to receive government benefits (both state and federal) due to a physical disability and/or mental disability. However, if these individuals are gifted assets or inherit assets, then they may no longer qualify for any government assistance, so it is important to understand that if you want a special needs individual to receive part of your estate, then you will need to do specific planning to ensure that the individual will continue to receive government assistance.Long Term Care Planning, Medicaid Planning and Veterans BenefitsUnfortunately, many people don't think about planning for their long-term health care needs until a crisis hits. Proactive long-term care planning is the only way to ensure that your health care needs will be met without having to spend all of your assets on your care. Medicaid planning is a subcategory of long term care planning and involves re-positioning and/or transferring assets in order to qualify for Medicaid nursing home benefits. Veterans benefits in relation to elder law encompass providing for the long-term health care needs of veterans of the U.S. armed forces.Estate PlanningEstate planning is the systematic approach to deciding who will receive your property after you die and who will be in charge of making sure your final wishes are carried out. Estate planning will include disability planning as discussed above as well as planning to avoid probate and minimize estate taxes and ensuring that your beneficiaries are protected from bad decisions, bad marriages, and outside influences.Guardianship and ConservatorshipWhen a person becomes mentally incapacitated, who will be able to make the incapacitated person's personal and financial decisions? If the person took the time to make a disability plan, then he or she will have the right legal documents in place and will be able to dictate who will make these decisions. But if the person does not have a disability plan, then a family member, friend, or, in some cases, a complete stranger, will have to go to court and request that a guardian or conservator be appointed on behalf of the incapacitated person. Guardianship, also referred to as conservatorship in some states, is sometimes to referred to as \"living probate\" since it is the court-supervised process of administering an incapacitated person's estate.Estate Settlement - Probate and Trust AdministrationProbate is the court-supervised process for settling a deceased person's estate. Probate may or may not be necessary depending on how the deceased person's assets were titled at the time of death. If the deceased person had a Revocable Living Trust, then the trust will need to be settled in a manner similar to probate but without the supervision of a probate court.Personal and Financial Elder AbuseAs people age, they unfortunately become prone to personal and/or financial abuse. This can range from \"granny kidnapping\" to outright theft of personal belongings and financial assets. Financial elder abuse can occur through the use of a Durable Power of Attorney or by undue influence, such as wrongfully coercing an elderly person to give away their assets or change their Last Will and Testament or Revocable Living Trust. This has led to a specialized area of litigation aimed at recovering the elderly person's assets."}

{"title": "The Differences Between EBITA & EBITDA & EPS", "text": "EBITA and EBITDA are both earnings streams, while EPS, which stands for earnings per share, is another level of earnings expressed on a per share basis. EBITA is an acronym for earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, and is an acronym for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EPS is based on net earnings, which can also be referred to as earnings after taxes. Therefore, the primary differences between the three different earnings streams are:\n\nEarnings used in EPS reflects deductions for interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nEBITA is equal to earnings plus interest, taxes and amortization.\n\nEBITDA is equal to EBITA plus depreciation.\n\nEPS is equal to net earnings divided by the number of common shares issued and outstanding.\n\nDifferent Uses\n\nInvestors and creditors often assign greater importance to EBITA and EBITDA results than EPS. Adding back depreciation and amortization, both noncash items, results in an earnings measure that is more akin to gross cash flow than net earnings. Depreciation and amortization are expenses for accounting purposes, but do not result in direct cash outflows.\n\nEBITDA, in particular, is favored by investors because it reflects results irrespective of , measured by interest costs, and fixed capital allocations, as measured by depreciation. Amortization expenses also serve to reduce earnings solely on an accounting basis. Focusing on EBITDA, particularly in industries that employ substantial debt financing and are capital-intensive, allows investors to compare financial results independent of these items.\n\nCompany Valuation\n\nEBITDA and EPS are key metrics used in . The well-known Price to Earnings ratio is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its EPS. However, in most non-financial industries, investors use EBITDA multiples for valuation purposes. This holds true for both public and private companies. Private companies are valued by applying multiples derived from publicly traded peer companies to the subject company's metrics such as book value and EBITDA. Another market-based valuation method obtains transaction multiples from acquisitions of controlling interests of both public and private companies, and applying these multiples in the same way.\n\nApplying the Price to Earnings ratio, calculated using EPS, results in a market value of equity. Applying EBITA and EBITDA multiples result in enterprise value, from which interest-bearing debt must be subtracted in order to arrive at the market value of equity. This is because EPS reflects an after-debt income stream that is only available to shareholders. EBITA and EBITDA reflect cash flows available to both shareholders and creditors, because deductions for interest expense are not considered within the calculation."}
{"title": "Focus on an Investment&#39;s Total Return Not Capital Gains", "text": "One of the most frustrating things I experience as a professional is encountering new investors who lament the fact that a stock they own hasn\u2019t generated substantial capital gains by increasing in market price over several years. Yet, if you asked them the total cash dividend return they had earned during the same time period, it is likely they would give you a blank look. (As you have already learned in the beginner\u2019s guide to dividends, dividends represent part of a company\u2019s profit that is paid out to stockholders, who are the owners. They are declared by the Board of Directors and the total percentage of the profit that is paid out is known as the dividend payout ratio. Companies that are older, more mature, and don\u2019t have as many opportunities for expansion likely have higher dividend payout ratios than those that are young, small, and fast growing.)An illustration may help underscore my point.  Imagine you were a partner in a private manufacturing business and your shares were valued at $500,000. For ten years, you hold on to this stock and the value never increases, yet during this same time period, you receive $1,500,000 in cash dividends. Obviously, this has been a great investment and you should be thrilled. Every year, you receive substantial checks in the mail as a result of your ownership. However, if you were to listen to the media, or look at a stock chart, you would consider your investment a total failure. Why? The financial media doesn\u2019t include the total dividends received in determining the return shareholders have earned by owning a stock. In fact, in this case, your stock chart would show a flat line, leading many new investors to believe you had actually lost money after inflation over the decade you held your shares.  (On my personal blog, I explained the three things stock chart providers should include to drastically increase their accuracy for long-term investors were they so inclined to do so.)I believe this oversight is professional malpractice. Can you imagine going to a doctor who didn\u2019t know how to read an X-Ray? The tragedy is that this phenomenon is relatively new. Up until the great bull market that began in the 1980s, it was said that the purpose of a company was to pay dividends, which forced a focus on total return rather than capital gains alone. With people addicted to the pursuit of overnight riches and a gambling culture, it became much easier to envision yourself buying a stock and watching it go to the moon rather than buying a stock and slowly collecting cash along with underlying appreciation.If you need evidence this mindset pervades even the financial media consider this: A rather common mistake made by journalist is to point out that it took more than twenty years for the stock market to reach its former peak level after the Great Depression. Yet, several financial studies have shown that an investor who took advantage of disciplined dollar cost averaging and reinvested his or her dividends actually broke even in as little as 5-7 years, and by the time the market had returned to its former level, made an absolute mint.  This is due to something that Dr. Jeremy Siegel at Wharton University referred to as the \"bear market accelerator\" effect, which I discussed in a post about investing in the oil majors.Why This Focus on Total Return and Not Capital Gains Should Matter to YouMost of the biggest companies in the world pay out a substantial, if not majority, of the annual profit generated from operations in the form of a cash dividend. Firms such as Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Apple, Exxon Mobil, Nestle, United Technologies, McDonald's, and The Walt Disney Company often return the money earned throughout the year to stockholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchase programs. In Why Boring Is Almost Always More Profitable, I discussed the work of the aforementioned Dr. Jeremy Siegel, who showed that 99% of the real, inflation-adjusted return investors earn is the result of reinvesting their dividends, especially on quality firms such as these. That means that if you own blue chip stocks, you don\u2019t need share prices to increase very much before you begin growing wealthier.The implications for the average investor are clear: If you own an index fund that invests based on the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average, most of your money is going to be put to work in companies with substantial dividend distributions. That means that a material percentage of your long-term return is going to come from reinvested dividends, not capital gains. It may be about as exciting as watching paint dry, but if you get richer in the end, it shouldn't matter.Taking the Next Step to Focusing on Total ReturnOnce you understand the importance of total return, you need to read Calculating Total Return and CAGR. It will explain how you can use some simple algebra to determine the rate of return you earned on an investment during the time you owned it, including the dividends you received.

{"title": "Which Debts Are Not Discharged in Chapter 7?", "text": "There are certain types of debt that the Bankruptcy Code tells us will not be discharged in a typical bankruptcy case. These usually fall into two broad categories: debts that are always nondischargeable, and debts that will be discharged unless a creditor files an objection in the bankruptcy court.  In this article, we talk about the ones that are automatically nondischargeable. To learn more about the ones that will discharged unless a creditor objects, see Discharging Debts: Debts That May Be Discharged.Debts Not Listed in the Bankruptcy PaperworkAny debts that were not listed in the bankruptcy paperwork, also called the bankruptcy schedules, will not be discharged because those creditors will not get notice of the bankruptcy case and will not be able to participate in the case. This includes any debts that were not listed in a prior bankruptcy case.But, if your creditor learns of your bankruptcy case through some other method, the debt is discharged. This is because a creditor with knowledge of the bankruptcy case can participate in it by filing a claim or otherwise notifying the court that it is aware of the case.Many creditors learn of bankruptcy cases because they subscribe to services like Banko Solutions. Large creditors, like credit card companies and banks, will compare their customer databases to the information gathered by Banko and similar services to determine which of their customers have filed bankruptcy.In some jurisdictions, the bankruptcy courts have held that debts not listed in the bankruptcy paperwork will be discharged anyway if the oversight was not intentional and if the creditor would not have received any distributions from the case, which happens in most bankruptcy cases.TaxesMany learned authorities have written books about taxes and bankruptcy. This is perhaps the most complicated subject in all of bankruptcy law.Dischargeability of taxes depends on a number of factors, including type of tax, type of bankruptcy filed, when returns are filed, and how old the taxes are.We have set out some general rules about the discharge of different types of taxes in two articles:     Discharging Debt: Business, Sales and Property Taxes     Discharging Debt: Federal and State Income TaxesDebts that Arise Out of Family Law ProceedingsMost family law debt will not be discharged in a bankruptcy case (but there are exceptions).A number of different kinds of debts can come out of a family law case: child support, alimony, property settlements, attorneys fees and more.The Bankruptcy Code talks about two different types of family law debt. One is the \u201cDomestic Support Obligation,\u201d and the other is debt that arises out of a property settlement.Domestic Support Obligations includeSpousal or child supportAlimonyMaintenanceDebts that arise from separation agreementsAttorneys fees in child support and spousal support casesMost debts that arise from hold-harmless clausesMost guardian ad litem feesProperty settlement debt usually arises when the parties agree to a divide property, but the property division will occur in the future, or over time, and a debt arises when one party is obligated to pay the other party.For most purposes, domestic support obligations and property settlements are treated alike. In a Chapter 7 case, both domestic support obligations and property settlements are not dischargeable. But, in a Chapter 13 case, property settlements can be dischargeable. This area can be very confusing for debtors and attorneys alike because often the court must decide if the property settlement is actually a domestic support obligation in disguise. To learn more about how these debts are treated in bankruptcy, seeDischarge of Domestic Support Obligations and Other Divorce-Related DebtDomestic Support Obligations in Chapter 13 Why File a Bankruptcy Claim for Divorce-Related Debts?Debts to Government AgenciesDebts to government agencies, including federal, state and local governments, are almost always nondischargeable. This includes court fines and penalties and criminal restitution.There are exceptions, however. If the fine is actually designed to reimburse the government for money it lost because of you, it may be dischargeable. For instance, if the city government had to cut your grass because it got too high or had to clear a condemned structure from your property, that cost might be discharged in a bankruptcy case if it designed to reimburse the city for a cost that you should have incurred yourself. But, if the city imposed a fine designed to punish you, like a speeding ticket, that debt would not be discharged.Other debts to the government that may be dischargeable include SBA business loans and FHA home loans.Student LoansStudent loans are difficult, but not impossible to discharge in bankruptcy. Because this area is complicated, we have written an entire series of articles to guide you in dealing with your student loans if you file a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13 case. Here are some articles to get you started:Managing Student Loans: IntroductionManaging Student Loans: Your Options in a NutshellDebts for Personal Injury Due to IntoxicationIf you cause personal injury because you were intoxicated while operating a motor vehicle, any debt that arises from that injury will not be discharged in a bankruptcy case.Homeowner Association FeesIf you live in a condominium or a co-operative apartment, you will pay a monthly, quarterly or annual fee for upkeep of the common areas. Many owners of free-standing houses also pay a local homeowner\u2019s association a periodic fee, especially in planned developments or newer suburban neighborhoods. These fees are not dischargeable in a bankruptcy case.This can be a real problem for a debtor when a home is surrendered to the lender. The HOA fees don\u2019t just go away when that happens. You will remain responsible for the HOA dues as long as the property remains in your name, even if you filed bankruptcy and are not living in the home. If your lender does not foreclose quickly or chooses not to foreclose, you could find yourself owing a lot of money to the HOA.For more information:To learn more about the debts that can and cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy case, be sure to visit these pages:Discharge OverviewDischarge vs dischargeabilityChallenging the general discharge and discharge of particular debtsDischargeability of particular debtsIncome taxesBusiness, sales and property taxesChild support and alimony, including attorney\u2019s feesFines, penalties, restitution, court ordered paymentsStudent loans (with certain exceptions)Injuries to persons and propertyDebts from DUI/DWI related accidentsFraudRecent credit card charges and cash advancesDischarging car loans, home loans and other secured debtReaffirmations and other exceptions to dischargeLitigating discharge challenges"}
{"title": "Support Your Military Members", "text": "Until 9/11, there were two primary programs which allowed the general public to send mail to \"any servicemember:\" the Military Postal Service's \"Dear Any Servicemember\" program, which operated year-round, and the annual \"Operation Dear Abby\" program which supported troops with letters and cards from home during the holiday season.Then that nut (or nuts) began sending out anthrax-infected letters, shortly after 9/11, and this resulted in the termination of both programs. The Pentagon was afraid that some nut (or nuts) would attempt to send harmful letters and packages to our military members involved in the fight against terrorism. DOD established a policy that all mail to deployed servicemembers must be addressed to a specific military member, and have his/her correct address (in essence limiting mail and packages to those sent by friends and family members).Holiday CardsBeginning in December 2007, Americans can now send holiday cards (between mid-November and mid-December) to deployed servicemembers and wounded warriors in military hospitals, through a special program administered by the American Red Cross, called \"Holiday Mail for Heroes.\" Under this program, approved by the Pentagon, volunteers screen the cards for hazards and to ensure the contents are appropriate (no military \"hate-messages\" allowed).Starting this fall and throughout the holiday season, the Red Cross is working to collect and distribute holiday cards to American service members of the U.S. military, veterans and their families in the United States and around the world.The process is very simple and takes no time at all - All you need is a pen and piece of paper to share your appreciation for the sacrifices members of the U.S. Armed Forces make to protect our freedoms The Holiday Mail for Heroes mail box is open and ready to receive your cards.

Visit the  Red Cross website for this information, around mid-November each year).All cards must be signed.Please use generic salutations such as \u201cDear Service Member.\u201d Cards addressed to specific individuals can not be delivered through this program.Send only cards -- not long letters. Long letters delay the review process.Do not do not include email or home addresses on the cards. This program is not meant to foster pen pal relationships.Do not include inserts of any kind, including photos, as these items will be removed during the reviewing process.Other Ways to Support the TroopsOther than the Red Cross's Holiday Card program, there are other ways you can show support for our troops during the holidays and year-round.In 2004, the Pentagon established the America Supports You website, which listed more than 350 homefront groups that provide a variety of support for military members and their families. This program has since been discontinued, however,the spirit and intent of the America Supports You Program continues. The Department of Defense (DoD) uses www.OurMilitary.mil to highlight and communicate our country\u2019s support for our military and their families.Whether you want to send a care package to a service member, write an email or letter, donate airline miles to help reunite returning military men and women with their families, purchase a phone card for a service member, support scholarship funds or send support to wounded service members, the 350 non-profit citizen organizations can help you make it happen.MILITARY ONE SOURCE \u2013 Need to adjust the holiday budget, manage expectations or simply find affordable and unique ways to enjoy the Holiday?

{"title": "22 Business Networking Tips and Tricks", "text": "Networking events have been part of the business scene for as long as anyone can remember - and will continue into the foreseeable future because even in the modern age of social media marketing, face to face business networking is still an excellent way to establish relationships with potential clients and increase your sales. This article presents the networking tips and tricks you need to make your next business networking event a success.22 Networking Tips1. When you arrive at a networking event, avoid gravitating to people you know. You should initially thank the host and then immediately find someone new to introduce yourself to. This will help keep you in the right frame of mind as to why you came.2. Stop selling and start listening! When you meet someone for the first time, use it as an opportunity to get to know them. Don't try to sell them anything. Rather, begin to establish a relationship. For more information on how to be a good listener see Speak For Success - Listening.3. Keep your business cards in the breast pocket of your coat, a shirt pocket, or in an outside pocket of your purse so they are easy to access and in good condition (see 7 Reasons You Still Need Business Cards). The same with your mobile phone - if the other party has a compatible device you can exchange contact info instantly via apps such as AirDrop for iOS.4. When giving a person your card, personalize it by hand writing a note or additional contact information on it. This will cause the recipient to feel that they are receiving something special.5. When giving or receiving a business card, be especially careful when dealing with people from outside North America as many cultures treat them with very high regard. (In many countries in Asia the exchange of business cards is an important ritual, for instance.)6. When receiving a business card from someone, take a moment to write yourself a note on it such as where you met. If you do this while you're still talking to the person, it will help convey your sense of personal connection.7. During the course of a conversation at a networking event, use the other person's first name two or three times. People always like to hear their own name and it will help you to remember it when the discussion is over.8. The best business networking tip: rather than telling a new contact all about yourself, spend your time asking them questions. It's amazing how much you'll learn!9. After you meet someone for the first time, use the back of their business card to jot a note about something you learned from the conversation and the date and place you met them (or enter the information into your mobile device - a mobile Customer Relationship Management (CRM) app is ideal for this purpose). Recording the information will give you something to talk to them about the next time you see them.10. Connect with the person you're talking to by tilting your head as you listen to them. It is an effective body language technique which communicates that you're paying attention to what they're saying.11. When a person is talking to you be sure to look directly at them. Giving a person full attention with your eyes will encourage them to share more.12. When giving someone eye contact, remember it's not a \"stare-down\" contest. Give the person 3 to 5 seconds of eye contact and then look away briefly before returning your focus to them again.13. The best location for networking is by a high-traffic area such as a main door, the bar, or near the food.14. Never approach someone if they are walking towards the restroom or if they have a phone in their hand. Wait until they have returned to the networking area or put their phone away.15. After the person has shared something with you, ask them another question about what they just said. This shows that you're paying attention and that you care about what they're telling you.16. Always keep one hand free to allow yourself to shake hands with people. This means that you shouldn't eat and drink at the same time. Remember, you're there to network, not eat a full-course meal.17. As a way of demonstrating your networking skills, introduce each new person you meet to at least one other person.18. Never try to barge into a group of four or more people. Come along side of the group, but do not attempt to enter into the discussion until you've made eye contact with everyone and a minimum of two other people in the group have said something.19. Do not approach two people who are talking, as you may be interrupting an important discussion.20. Initiate conversation with someone who is standing by themselves. They'll be happy to have someone to talk to them and, as a result, will many times open up with valuable information.21. When you meet someone for the first time, you have 48 hours to follow up with them before they will completely forget about meeting you.22. A networking event is not a time to see how many business cards you can acquire. Rather, it is a time to develop a few relationships that have potential.It's Not Just a Meet and Greet - It's a Hope to RemeetWhen attending an event, it's important to have the perspective that your goal should be to help others first. Unfortunately, it's an old clich\u00e9 that is often left at the door. The next time you're headed to a networking event, keep in mind the following simple, helpful rule: after it's all said and done, you want to have earned the right, privilege, honor, and respect to be able to meet with them again. This is not a license to sell yourself, but an opportunity to build relationships.See also:The Ten Commandments of NetworkingJoin a Business OrganizationHow to Create a Social Media PlanHow to Be ProfessionalWhat to Look for in a CRM System for Small Business"}

How credit scores affect mortgage rates Borrowers with high credit scores tend to get lower interest rates on mortgages than borrowers with low credit scores. A credit score of 740 or higher qualifies for the best interest rates from most lenders.\nIt is difficult, but possible, to get a mortgage with a credit score under 620.\nThe difference between the best and worst rates can vary by a full percentage point and a half. Not only is a high credit score vital in getting a low mortgage rate, it influences whether you can get a home loan at all. Buyers below a certain threshold, typically a FICO score of 620, have a better chance of striking oil in their bathtub than securing a mortgage. It's possible, but it will require some digging.\nGet prequalified today with mortgage lenders you'll find on Bankrate.com.\nA credit score of 740 or more should qualify for the best mortgage rates from most lenders. Depending on the lender, the mortgage rates offered to the highest and lowest credit tiers can vary as much as a full percentage point and a half, says Louis Spagnuolo, a former vice president of mortgage banking at WCS Lending in Boca Raton, Florida.\nOne percentage point makes a big difference Monthly principal and interest payments on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for $200,000 Interest rate Monthly principal and interest 4% $954.83 5% $1,073.64\nRATE SEARCH: Good credit can save you thousands on your mortgage. Check your credit score free at myBankrate.\nWhat lenders look for\nLenders prefer borrowers with low balances, a long history of on-time payments and a mix of credit utilization -- for instance, a car loan and a couple of revolving accounts such as credit cards.\n\"Lenders look at several variables on the credit report: outstanding debt, the outstanding debt relative to the total available debt; the length of the credit history, and the pursuit of new credit -- how many inquiries are on your report,\" says Matt Hackett, underwriting manager at Equity Now, a direct mortgage lender in New York.\nHow to clean up your credit\nIdeally, you'll check your credit report a year or so before buying a home. That gives you time to correct errors in the report and change ways you use credit to improve your score.\nTo get a sense of where your credit stands, go to myBankrate to collect your credit report and score today, free and with no obligation. Scour everything from the way your name is spelled and previous addresses to checking that each and every account is yours and reported correctly. If an account has been closed, make sure that is accurately reported.\n\"Sometimes people will quickly glance over their information and that's it. But you should take the time and look at the account numbers,\" says Steve Katz, senior marketing communications executive for TransUnion.\nCorrect and wait\nAll 3 credit bureaus make it easy to dispute errors online.\nIf everything is correct, pay down balances and let time do the rest.\nThe credit reporting agencies do charge a fee if you want to know your credit score. Lenders look at all 3 scores and use the middle one, Hackett says.\nWhat else you can do\nIf you're buying a home soon, try not to apply for new credit. Though it's not always avoidable -- for instance, if you need a car loan or college financing -- you should resist opening several new lines of credit in a short time. Multiple new accounts can decrease your credit score.\nRATE SEARCH: And if you're already ready to shop for a mortgage, find the best deal today by searching Bankrate.com."}

{"title": "How to Use a Debit Card", "text": "If debit cards are new to you, you may not (yet) know how to use one. It's easier than you think. We'll cover a few basic examples below, and you'll have a clear idea of how to use your card in no time.How to Use a Debit CardDebit cards can be used for payment almost anywhere that credit cards are accepted. That includes restaurants, merchants, online retailers, and government organizations. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part it's as easy as swiping your debit card when you check out (or, if paying online, by typing in your card number). Just run the black magnetic strip on the back of your card through the card machine (or dip the smart chip, if you have one), and sign for the transaction if needed.In some establishments, you pay with your debit card by handing it to an employee who will run it through a card reader for you. While convenient, the practice is also risky, so you should only hand your card to somebody that you trust: anybody who has your card in their possession can copy information from the card, and use that information to make fraudulent purchases on your account.How to Use a Debit Card at an ATMDebit cards can be used to get cash out of your checking account at an automated teller machine (ATM). To do this, insert your card into the ATM's card reader. If you're not sure how the card goes in, look for a diagram that looks similar to your card. It will indicate which side goes up, and which side should face left or right (look for something similar to the black stripe on the back of your card).Once the ATM has read your card, it will ask you to enter your personal identification number (PIN). Type in your PIN while blocking your hand from view (you don't want anybody else to see what you type in at this point). Then, follow the instructions on screen to make withdrawals, view your balance, or transfer money.If you had to insert your debit card into the machine and it held onto the card, be sure to wait until your card is returned to you before walking away.How to Use a Debit Card OnlineIf you're paying for something online, you can generally use your debit card as if it was a credit card. You don't need to specify that you want to use a debit card (just select the \"pay with credit card\" option). Start by indicating the type of card you have: Visa or MasterCard, for example. Then, type in the 16 digit number on the front of your debit card. You'll also have to enter the expiration date, which you can find after the words \"good through\" or \"valid through.\"You may also be asked for a CCD, CVV, or similar security code. This is a three or four digit code that helps prove that you are really authorized to use the card. This code can be found on the back of most cards towards the far right (often printed on the card in black ink after your card number). On American Express cards, the code is on the front of the card (again, in black ink on the far right).To use a debit card online, you'll need to know the correct billing address linked to that card. With most debit cards, this is your home address. However, you may have difficulty using prepaid debit cards if you do not know what address to use.If you plan to make payments online, be sure that your computer will keep thieves from stealing your card information. Keep your security software up to date, and only use your card on sites that you trust. You should also check to make sure that your card information will be sent over a secure connection when shopping online.How to Use a Prepaid Debit CardPrepaid cards are very similar to traditional bank-issued debit cards. The main difference is that they are not linked to your bank account. Instead, they are linked to a pool of money available to you. In most cases, you can use a prepaid debit card as if it was any other card \u2013 as long as you have sufficient funds available, nobody's going to care that you have a prepaid card.You might eventually use up all of the funds available on your prepaid debit card. At that point, some cards allow you to \"reload\" and add funds to the card. The process for reloading varies from card to card (you might have to go to a store and pay cash, or you might transfer funds from your bank).If you're going to use a prepaid debit card, keep an eye on the fees you pay. These cards are typically (but not always) more expensive than debit cards issued by banks.Should You Use a Debit Card or Credit Card?Debit cards make it easy to make payments. However, when it comes to debit cards that are linked to your checking account, there is some risk involved: that card is linked directly to your bank account. If your card is stolen (or if somebody steals the information from your card), your checking account could get drained by a thief. You are protected \u2013 as long as you report the problem to your bank immediately \u2013 but a temporarily empty bank account can cause stress and other problems.If that concerns you, you can use a credit card for day-to-day use and online shopping instead of using your debit card. Credit cards have more consumer protections, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 the money doesn\u2019t leave your bank account before you become aware of any problems. Simply pay off your entire credit card balance in full every month (if you were using a debit card before, you weren\u2019t borrowing anyway) and you can avoid interest charges."}
{"title": "Which Debit Card Is Best for Teens?", "text": "Teens who earn wages at a job or receive a sizable allowance benefit from lessons in money management. Debit cards are a great way for teens to learn the ins and outs of everyday transactions without the risks associated with a credit card. Depending on how much control you want to relinquish and your tolerance for fees, prepaid cards, student debit cards, regular debit cards and joint debit cards can all be good options for your teen.\n\nPrepaid debit cards often come with monthly charges and reload fees.\n\ncredit: Jack Hollingsworth/Photodisc/Getty Images\n\nPrepaid Debit Cards\n\nIf you want to strictly limit how much money your teen has access to, a prepaid card may be the way to go. Rather than being linked to a bank account like a regular debit card, a prepaid card must be loaded with funds before teens can use it. Having to constantly reload cash onto the card makes teens less likely to go overboard with spending. However, these cards can also come with hefty fees. Along with the initial activation fee, some cards charge monthly fees, cash reload fees, ATM fees and customer service fees. Read the fine print carefully and choose a card with minimal fees, such as the American Express Bluebird card.\n\nRegular Debit Cards\n\nMany parents are concerned that teens will blow their savings with a traditional debit card. However, a regular debit card can be a great option for teens as long as it's not linked to a savings account. As long as you decline overdraft coverage and protection for your teen's card, he can spend only the balance in his checking account. If he keeps a low balance in his account, your teen may have to pay a monthly fee for the checking account. But, unlike prepaid cards, traditional debit cards rarely have ongoing maintenance and usage fees.\n\nStudent Debit Cards\n\nIf you like the idea of a regular debit card but want to minimize fees, many banks waive monthly maintenance fees for student checking and savings accounts. Although most parents assume these accounts are designed for college students, some banks will grant student checking accounts to high school students. As with a regular checking account, you can deny overdraft protection to ensure your teen doesn't spend past his means. Many banks require students to move to a regular checking account after they've graduated from college.\n\nJoint Bank Account Debit Card\n\nIf you want a really easy way to keep tabs on what your teen is buying, you can create a joint bank account in both of your names. This allows you to easily check account activity and deposit funds for your teen to spend. Although you have more control in this situation, there's a downside for your teen. If you're the one controlling the funds and can bail out your teen if he spends too much, he may not learn the lessons of financial responsibility and restraint."}
{"title": "I Just Graduated College. How Do I Start Building Credit?", "text": "Congratulations! You have successfully graduated from college! All that hard work has resulted in a cap, a gown, a diploma and now \u2026 fiscal responsibility. Of all the things you\u2019ll need to accomplish after college, the building of a great credit score is one of the most important and will serve you well throughout life.\nAccording to Fair Isaac Co., your FICO score is based on the following: payment history (35%), amount owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit (10%), and type of credit (10%). Its competitor, VantageScore, uses the same criteria, though in slightly different proportions. So it stands to reason that activities that involve these criteria are the activities you\u2019ll want to focus on.\nApply for a credit card. As a recent grad, you\u2019ll be inundated with credit card offers. Use our tools at NerdWallet to determine which card is best for you. Begin charging expenses (while noting if certain charges earn bonuses). I recommend keeping a budget as a basic financial tool anyway, so keep track of how much you put on your card. It\u2019s easy to \u201cjust charge it\u201d and suddenly find you have a balance you can\u2019t afford to pay off. Pay off your balance in full each month. This is a habit you should form right from the beginning, by never charging more than you know you can pay each month. If you overspend and can\u2019t pay in full, you\u2019ll start to accrue interest. For first-time cardholders, interest rates can be very high. Make yourself happy by avoiding paying interest. It also helps your credit score. Pay off your balance on time, every time. Remember, 35% of your credit score is based on payment history. Do whatever it takes to remind yourself of your card\u2019s payment due date. One of the easiest ways to make sure you don\u2019t miss that date is if your credit card company allows you to make automated payments from your bank account. This permits the card company to reach into your bank account on the same day each month. Just make sure that your bank account has enough money in it, so you don\u2019t get overdrawn. Late payments are a big negative mark on your credit, so this task is critical. Don\u2019t over-apply for credit. The more times your credit report is examined (\u201cpulled\u201d) by a creditor, the lower your score. So be picky, especially if you know you\u2019ll need to get a car loan or credit from a furniture or appliance store. Type of credit is also a factor, so having cards and a couple of loans helps your score. Check your credit score. Federal law requires that each of the three major credit bureaus provide you with a free credit report each year. Check in on your credit score at least twice a year, or even quarterly. It\u2019s rewarding to see your credit score creep up as you behave responsibly.\nThe overriding advice here is to be diligent and responsible. Keep a budget. Monitor your expenses. Every Sunday night, check your bank and card balances online to make sure everything is in order. Awareness is the first rule of financial responsibility.\nWoman holding credit card.

From financial fraud to fighting terrorism, the FBI offers opportunities for agents to specialize in a host of criminal investigations.Though their jurisdiction is restricted to within the United States and its territories, FBI agents also work around the world assisting foreign investigative bodies when U.S. citizens are victims or suspects of certain crimes.FBI agents receive training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, VA and must be willing to work anywhere they are assigned. There are multiple hiring tracks, depending on an individual's are of expertise, level of education and prior law enforcement experience.The original men in black, secret service agents have two very unique roles within law enforcement. Most famously, the U.S. Secret Service is responsible for protecting the President of the United States, as well as other high-ranking U.S. officials and visiting foreign leaders. Agents are experts in dignitary protection, and they provide training to state and local law enforcement.Besides protecting POTUS, Secret Service agents safeguard the U.S. financial system by investigating incidents of money laundering, financial fraud, and especially counterfeiting.The Air Force Office of Special Investigations supports the United States Air Force by investigating major or violent crimes involving Air Force personnel, conducting internal investigations, and gathering intelligence on enemy forces, and investigating threats to Air Force interests and assets.Modeled after the FBI, AFOSI has broad investigative responsibilities everywhere the U.S. Air Force has a presence. Special agents come from both civilian and military ranks and must be ready and willing to live and work almost anywhere in the world. AFOSI is also the national leader in cyber crimes investigations and hosts the Defense Cyber Crime Center.Like Air Force investigators, U.S. Army special agents are responsible for conducting internal and criminal investigations of Army military and civilian personnel. Nearly any crime involving Army interests may fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Command, though the focus is primarily on crimes of violence, fraud and other major violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Army investigators are highly trained and consist of civilian special agents and military police personnel. Agents must be highly educated and ready to work anywhere in the world.Perhaps best known among military law enforcement careers due to the television series NCIS, special agents within the Department of the Navy conduct major investigations involving members of the United States Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.NCIS agents conduct independent investigations, as well as assist local law enforcement when a local investigation involves Navy personnel or interests.Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Homeland Security investigators work within the United States Department of Homeland Security and conduct specialized investigations into threats to U.S. citizens as well as violations of customs laws.ICE and Homeland Security agents are primarily focused on keeping dangerous individuals from entering the U.S., preventing human trafficking, investigating international money laundering and assisting in drug enforcement efforts.Agents of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives serve an important roll in regulating vices and helping to keep dangerous weapons and materials out of the hands of criminals.ATF agents are tasked with investigating the trafficking of firearms, arson investigations, illegal sales of alcohol and tobacco products, and the sale, transfer and use of explosives and explosive materials. ATF agents conduct extensive undercover operations. They may be required to travel for extended periods of time.The Drug Enforcement Agency is the federal agency on the forefront of the fight against drugs. Agents work very closely with state, local and foreign law enforcement agencies and perform undercover investigations. They also provide intelligence and training support to law enforcement agencies around the country.The DEA prefers agents to hold, at a minimum, a four-year degree. Preference is given to those with prior law enforcement experience and advanced degrees.The U.S. Department of Defense is a huge bureaucracy that hosts the four war-fighting branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. While each individual branch employs its own special investigative body, Department of Defense special agents are uniquely tasked with conducting investigations of instances of fraud and financial crimes, particularly as they relate to procurement and executions of military contracts.The Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Services works to protect DoD personnel by ensuring purchased equipment is delivered and operative. The service's primary mission is to ensure the safety of all civilian and military DoD personnel. DCIS also assists other agencies in investigating cyber crimes and national security threats."}
{"title": "7 Myths of Freelance Writing", "text": "I\u2019ve been doing this for a decade now, and most of my close family and friends still aren\u2019t exactly sure what I do. There are a lot of myths and misperceptions out there when it comes to the freelance writing career, and I\u2019m happy to dispel some of the rumors. Here are seven myths about the freelance writing career.You Can Make Your Own ScheduleI\u2019ve often found that when a friend calls or a fellow PTA mom asks me to watch her kids in the early afternoon, the understanding is that I can do whatever I want when I want to, and these types of mini-interruptions won't upset my balance.Ok, that\u2019s half true.I can generally massage my schedule, but know this: when I\u2019m on the beach on a summer Friday at 1:00 p.m., it probably means I buckled down and worked double the week before. Or, that I\u2019ll be working on Saturday to make up for it. There is one exception, though: deadlines are deadlines. If my deadline is at 7:00 a.m. on a Monday, I need to finish on Friday before, or I\u2019ll be working the weekend. So, yeah, I guess to a point I make my own schedule, but this little fantasy only occurs at the mercy and whims of my clients and projects.You Don\u2019t Have to Get DressedWell, I will admit that it was awesome when my kids graduated from elementary school, and I no longer had to get out of the car to pick them up. Pajama pants? OK!But, actually, this is what I\u2019ve learned: I need to feel \u201cput together,\u201d or I cannot write in a put-together manner. I also gravitate to the couch if I\u2019m too comfy. Secondly, I\u2019ve currently got two local clients who have events, press conferences and meetings (and so forth). They make me get dressed. And my national and international clients often request  Skype meetings, so then there\u2019s makeup to be had (boo!). For real, there\u2019s a little give here\u2014no more suits, thank goodness, but you can't be a schlub!You Can Raise Your Kids as a Stay at Home MomUm, no. And I know that depresses a great many of you who happen onto my site via those \u201cwork-at-home-mom\u201d groups. It\u2019s a great job for mothers, don\u2019t get me wrong, but you cannot work with a baby or toddler in the house under your direct care all day. It does not make for professional matters in your business, and it does not make for good writing. You must either switch off with another caregiver (and, really, writing some nights and weekends isn\u2019t that bad of an option), or you can wait until your kids are in school six hours a day, and spend that six hours trying to do eight hours of work like I do. Even with kids in school, your day will be interrupted at about 3:00 p.m. with sports and activity needs, friend drama and so on. But, it does allow a bit more work to be done that a crying baby or a bored toddler!You Will Now Be Poor/RichSo, back when the economy tanked, there were many people who \u201cfreelanced\u201d as a way to fill employment gaps in their resume, and I began hearing a lot about the \u201cpoor freelancer.\u201d By that time, my freelance writing and communications consultancy were already established, so I didn\u2019t know a lick about that kind of thing. I\u2019ve consistently made equal to or more than my last full-time job.At the same time, I bill anywhere from $35 (for family friends) to $105 an hour. There are some projects that have yielded as much as $200 an hour (some) (few). But, when I tell people my hourly rates, they make assumptions about how much I\u2019m making overall, without thinking about things like taxes (including an awful self-employment tax rate), maintaining an office or paying sub-contractors. Nope, we're not all rich, either.There is a reality here, though. I can control my income much better and more proactively than I ever have in any traditional job setting. I can ramp my production up or down depending on my family\u2019s needs. I never completely fill my hours, but with my daughter attending college in a couple years, it\u2019s good to know that option is there.There\u2019s No StressYeah, no, try again. As a freelancer, you are essentially running your own business\u2014even if you don\u2019t incorporate as a freelance business and do all your work as a sole, independent contractor. You still have to meet deadlines, you still have to pay expenses and you definitely still have to do a lot of juggling.There is some reality to this myth, though. Personally, I get stressed out in over-stimulating environments. Have 100% control of my work environment at my home office does reduce my stress significantly.You Have No BossSo, you\u2019re the boss, now, right? Kind of, but you also have five \u201cmini\u201d bosses (or however many clients you have), and each of them wants attention on their project. It\u2019s quite a challenge.The Artiste MythThe \u201cartiste\u201d myth says that you will work on and for your passions, and nothing else. Well, I don\u2019t know about you, but I have a mortgage to pay and bills constantly due. Whereas I try to stick with my niche areas, I also need to take on other paying work. Sometimes, the rate is just too good to pass up, or my niches aren\u2019t paying off, or whatnot. About a decade into this career, I\u2019d say my balance between niche areas and work that isn\u2019t my \u201cpassion\u201d is about 70-30. Not bad.So, what do you think?

For example, the Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage has unleashed a flurry of amended returns to reflect joint filing or married-filing-separately status, since the original returns were filed under different legal circumstances. General math errors. In its most recent report, the IRS reported more than 2.2 million math errors for 2013 individual tax returns, which represents about 1.5% of the approximately 147 million returns. The IRS usually will correct math or transposition errors during the initial processing of a filed tax return by comparing the return to supporting documents. However, it doesn\u2019t hurt to check for errors, particularly on things that the IRS might not be able to see, such as receipts. Issues surrounding itemized deductions (Schedule A). Schedule A contains most of your itemized deductions, including charitable contributions, mortgage interest and miscellaneous deductions. If you recently bought or refinanced a house, or if you do a lot of charitable work, it may benefit you to take a look at your Schedule A to see whether you should amend your return. Unrealized business deductions (Schedule C). Have a side gig, such as consulting or project-based work? If you do, but you never filed a Schedule C, chances are you\u2019ve missed some easy deductions. It\u2019s worth taking a closer look. Errors related to capital gains and losses (Schedule D). A lot of people make mistakes when recording capital gains or losses on their tax return. A common mistake is listing the sale price for a security, but forgetting to note the basis (purchase price plus commission). This applies not only to securities such as stocks and mutual funds, but also to the sale of your principal residence. When calculating your home\u2019s basis, don\u2019t forget to factor in the cost of major improvements, systems and renovations \u2014 think roof replacement, air conditioners, or kitchen remodeling. Major projects (not repairs) will increase your basis, therefore lowering your taxable gain. Real estate commissions and closing costs lower your taxable gain as well.\nThis article isn\u2019t meant to replace competent tax advice tailored to your specific situation, nor is it an all-inclusive list of potential errors in a tax return. If you\u2019re not sure what to do, consult a fee-only financial planner or tax professional in your area.\nImage via iStock."}

{"title": "Five Steps to a Better Career", "text": "So, you\u2019re ready for a new beginning\u2014a new career, and a better one at that. However, with student debt reaching the one trillion dollar mark this past year and the boom in media coverage of the student debt crisis, it\u2019s easy to understand why anyone would shy away from higher education. For many, it\u2019s not the learning that hurts as much as the bill afterwards.\nNerdWallet recently released a study on projected high growth careers\u2014jobs growing 25% or faster over the next decade\u2014and found that occupations requiring an Associate\u2019s Degree have the highest average growth rate. That\u2019s two years worth of learning for a new career that can last the rest of your life. Here are the steps you should take to find a new career that\u2019s right for you:\n1. Explore Potential Careers\nJob Security:\nIf you\u2019re going to invest in a new career, you\u2019ll want to know that there\u2019s a good probability that there\u2019s a job waiting for you at the end of the finish line. Job Security is a major contributor to job satisfaction. You can see the job growth for particular jobs up to 2020 using the BLS occupational handbook.\nAverage Salary:\nWhat good is a new job if you\u2019re not happy with the pay? Many workers seeking a new career dream of providing more for themselves and their families. It\u2019s best to know your facts up front and know what kind of life to expect after training. You can type in your potential occupation into any job search website to see what the average salary is.\n2. Research Potential Career Skills and Work Environment\nIt\u2019s been long known that a \u2018good\u2019 job is often subjective, but a key element recognized even by the BLS is that the day-to-day tasks and the environment play a big part in how one evaluates the quality of a job. Are you ok staying on your feet for the majority of your workday? Are you ok with interacting with patients? Everyone has his or her own strengths\u2014it\u2019s important to know which jobs will help you build on those strengths.\nA great way to understand a job is to try to find accounts of the day-to-day life online, or to find someone in that occupation in your personal network. A brief informational interview or just chatting with them about the pros and cons of their job can be enlightening and far better than reading a job description.\n3. Identify Educational Institutions that match your career goals\nWhere you obtain your education is a personal decision. You\u2019ll be investing your time and money into this this degree\u2014it\u2019s important to find a school with staff and faculty that will do the same.\nA couple of factors you should check with potential educational institutions are whether graduates have been able to find jobs. Are they marketable candidates for jobs after obtaining his or her degree?\nProspective students also need to be aware of scheduling issues. Make sure that you have the time to take the classes when they are offered or perhaps research night class options or other alternative scheduling to adapt to a working schedule.\n4. Speak to Advisors at Educational Institutions\nAdvisors are the best FAQ source\u2014they\u2019ve seen every problem, dealt with hundreds of students and know the processes within their school system. One of the key features you\u2019ll want to find out from advisors is the support you\u2019ll be able to receive as a student within the school.\nFind out how many financial aid advisors they have, if they have a career center and how many career advisors they have. Further, find out how students access these resources. Is a physical one-on-one appointment the only way to get your questions answered? Or is there an online forum or method that would be easier?\nIs there a career center? What type of services do they offer? Does the school host job fairs or help with career placement? Will they review your resume? Manu schools offer great support for their students, but it is on you to go out and take advantage of the opportunities.\n5. Calculate the costs and Find out Financial Aid possibilities\nYou can find out the cost of tuition, the average cost of books, and any other expenses directly from a school. Financial constraints can be one of the biggest hurdles for those pursuing a degree. Many students will take a break or stop completion of a degree completely due to personal or financial hardships. So, before you send in your enrollment forms, it\u2019s best to have a good understanding of the costs for school and a plan for tuition.\nFinancial Aid can be from the federal government, the state or from the school itself. To obtain federal aid, you\u2019ll have to fill out the FAFSA and send it in. Each state has a different set of instructions and deadlines for financial aid. It\u2019s best to speak to the Financial Aid advisor at your institution to get a better idea of what type of aid you could qualify for based on your particular circumstances.\nOnce you\u2019ve run through the 5 steps, it\u2019s ultimately up to you to decide whether sending in those enrollment forms is best for you. Switching to a brand new career can be a lot of work, so it\u2019s important to do your homework\u2014but the benefits could last a lifetime \u2013 literally. These 5 steps are a great starting point to put you on a pathway to a new career."}

{"title": "The Goldman Sachs Junior Analyst Program", "text": "Elimination of the Program: The Goldman Sachs Junior Analyst Program, instituted in the 1970s to develop top talent for its investment banking division, officially was eliminated by that firm in 2013. As with similar programs offered by its key rivals on Wall Street, many participants would use the Goldman program as a stepping stone to even more lucrative (and often much less stressful) positions elsewhere.Many of Goldman Sachs' competitors long have found it cheaper to poach talent developed there, than to cultivate it themselves. In fact, as the years rolled along, increasing numbers of junior analysts at Goldman Sachs apparently sought positions at other firms while still enrolled in the program, an activity that violated the terms of their employment contracts. In particular, private equity firms reportedly have been particularly aggressive in recent years in hiring top financial talent that was developed in the Goldman Sachs program.Hallmarks of the old Goldman Sachs program were a preponderance of grunt work and extremely long hours, including working overnight, sleeping in the office, and essentially being on call 24/7. Those who survived and thrived in this environment inevitably tended to be those who live to work rather than work to live.Among the so-called millennial generation, those born roughly between 1981 and 1997, the appetite for such a grueling pace is much lower than among older cohorts of workers. Those who sign on for heavy workloads such as those imposed on junior analysts increasingly do so with an eye towards leaving in short order for firms that offer better work-life balance, after building a resume and establishing a high level of pay. See our related articles on why Wall Street is losing talent to Silicon Valley and why top MBAs are avoiding Wall Street.New Initiative: In November 2015, Goldman Sachs announced a new set of initiatives aimed at improving the work environment and job prospects for its current crop of junior investment bankers, hoping that this will increase job satisfaction and employee retention among them. In particular, the firm promises to reduce the amount of pure grunt work and to speed up the availability of promotions for top performers.According to The Wall Street Journal (\"Goldman Sweetens Deal for Young Bankers: Bank adds the third year to the program, aims to relieve drudgery,\" November 5, 2015), Goldman hires about 2,000 junior analysts each year. Competition for these positions is fierce, and Goldman has its pick of talent. However, as noted above, retaining its analysis has become increasingly problematic. Pay for junior analysts in their first 2 years is a salary of about $85,000 plus participation in bonus pools. Those who are promoted to associate will earn significantly more. What Junior Investment Banking Analysts Do: Whether or not they are an informal program, junior investment banking analysts typically work under the direction of more senior investment bankers  or investment banking analysts. The work done by the junior analysts normally will cover:Proposed and pending dealsPitches made by investment bankers to existing and prospective clientsStudies commissioned by clientsThe specific tasks assigned to junior analysts will include, for example:Researching companiesAnalyzing financial statementsClosely reading financial documents and contractsAssembling presentations (such as pitch books)Other Analyst Programs at Goldman: However, Goldman Sachs indicates that it will retain two-year contracts for aspiring analysts in its sales and trading and investment research divisions. The primary reason is that participants in these programs have shown much greater loyalty to the firm, with many fewer defections to rival firms or MBA programs."}
{"title": "Types Of Debates And Tips For Holding Them", "text": "Debates are popular events because conflict is visceral. A speaker might be boring, but that same speaker can't afford to be boring in a debate. The stakes are higher.Watch a few debates before hosting one. Local newspapers and organizations like the League of Women Voters will host debates, as will universities and community colleges. Take the time to attend one or two of these to get a feel for how they work.There are different kinds of debates, each with a different format. Most people are familiar with them from watching the presidential debates, where the format rotates. ModeratedGround rules are usually negotiated ahead of time between the two sides -- or whoever is hosting the event decides the rules and that's it.Typically, each side gives an opening statement with a time limit.The moderator asks a question of one debater, who has a set amount of time to respond. Then the other person gives a rebuttal. Some moderators allow for a good back-and-forth to keep going. Other formats are more strict: question, 90 seconds for the response, 90 seconds for the rebuttal, next question.In some versions of this format, questions are suggested by the audience ahead of time and the moderator searches through the slips of paper to pick the best ones. Other formats have the moderator thinking up the questions and follow-up questions.  Town Hall DebateThe moderator takes a microphone and walks around the audience, letting citizens ask their questions, live, directly to the debaters.This gets the audience involved and can generate interesting questions. It's also unpredictable. You never know what topics will come up.  Lincoln-DouglasThis is a more open style of debate. There are usually time limits, but it's basically two people on a stage, debating each other.The topic is typically decided ahead of time.

{"title": "Are You Ready to Get a Credit Card?", "text": "There is no doubt that you will be inundated with credit card offers. You may receive several in the mail every single day. It can be tempting to sign up for every card that you are offered, but this would be a mistake. You should consider several things before filling out those credit card forms. You need to be sure that you are financially ready to take on the responsibility of a credit card. Credit cards are not really bad, if they are handled correctly. They can be a useful tool, but too many people make mistakes with their credit cards. Before you sign up for a card, make sure you are ready to handle it correctly. Why Are You Considering Getting a Credit Card?If you are getting a credit card in order to build credit, you need to make sure that you act responsibly with your card. You should pay off the balance in full each month. This means that you continue to stick to your budget. If you are getting the card so that you can purchase things that you just do not have the money for right now, then you should not even apply. You will have to pay for everything eventually and even though you may save ten dollars by purchasing those shoes now, if you do not pay it off immediately you may pay much more than that in interest.Look at the Interest RateMany cards will lure you with the introductory rate of zero percent interest. This is to encourage you to build a balance that you will not be able to pay off during the promotional time. Your interest rate may jump up to fifteen or twenty percent after the introductory period is over. If you are offered an interest rate as high as fifteen percent you should keep looking for another card.Look for a Card with No Annual FeeThere are so many credit cards available that you should not pay an annual fee in conjunction with your card. Many cards try to offer you cash back or other rewards as long as you pay an annual fee with the card. There are rewards cards that do not charge an annual fee, so you should keep looking.Consider the Rewards OfferedIf you are going to pay the entire balance at the end of every month, you should look carefully at the rewards that you can earn by using your credit card. Generally, the best deals are on the cash back cards. These cards return a percentage of your spending to you. You may be able to cash these rewards in for a higher amount on a gift card.Look at the PenaltiesIt is important to understand the penalties and fees that are associated with your card. The bank can raise your interest rates for one late payment. Additionally you will be charged a late fee. If you exceed your balance then you will be charge an overbalance fee and your interest rates will be raised as well. These interest rates can go as high as thirty percent.Limit the Number of Cards You HaveIdeally you should only have one or two credit cards total. This includes store credit cards. You do not need more than this. It is too easy to find yourself completely overwhelmed with debt if you have more than one credit card. The safest practice is to have just one credit card that you pay off entirely each month. If you feel like you need an additional card, consider taking out a prepaid credit card that does not charge a monthly fee or expire is it is inactive."}
{"title": "What Is the Difference Between Remodeling & Renovating?", "text": "Renovation and remodeling are similar but distinctive approaches to altering the current state of a structure or property. A main difference between the two is that renovating involves restoring something to its former state or improving upon it, while remodeling is completely alternating the structural or aesthetic nature of a property or structure.\n\nA building renovation is necessary if a natural disaster completely destroys a property.\n\nRenovation Basics\n\nRenovations are for both personal and business properties. A renovation restores the condition of a room or structure when common repairs or fixes are no longer adequate. Buildings are often renovated when their current structure is outdated and requires a major overhaul of the existing structure. Though the physical structure is restored or improved, the general function and purpose of the structure is maintained.\n\nRenovation Types\n\nThe three main types of renovations are cleaning, repairing or rebuilding. Additionally, building expansions are often considered renovation projects. Major cleaning or repairs become renovation when ongoing maintenance and care is not enough to prevent the property from fulfilling its purpose. Rebuilding is a major type of renovation and often involves demolishing and removing former physical structures and rebuilding from scratch.\n\nRemodeling Basics\n\nThe keyword that distinguishes a remodel from a renovation is \"alter.\" When you remodel a room or property, it is generally to completely change its use, functionality or aesthetics. Remodels may not even occur when structures are in generally good condition, if the occupant wants to change the use or look for a particular reason. Remodels often include more elements of design alternations versus physical structural work.\n\nRemodeling Purpose\n\nTwo reasons to remodel are for use and preference. People do remodels in homes to change the functionality; for instance, if an extra bedroom is needed, a remodel may mean changing an office into a bedroom. A business property remodel often takes place when a new type of business comes in, requiring a change in the functionality. People often do remodels in their home purely because of preference: they become bored with existing designs and aesthetics."}
{"title": "Taxes Basics: Withholding", "text": "While taxes affect you as soon as you're born, most of us don't even start thinking about them until the momentous day when we get our first paycheck. That's when we come to the distressing realization that we don't get to take home all the money we've worked so hard for. Uncle Sam is getting a piece of it, and sometimes it seems like it's a very big chunk of change.\nThis is because of something called payroll withholding, which is basically pay-as-you-earn taxation. While the IRS trusts us to file our taxes accurately and on time, the U.S. Treasury finds it easier to pay for federal programs if it gets some of the money before April each year. So taxes are taken out of your wages before you receive the money, deposited in an IRS account and credited to you when you file your return.\nYou can't get around withholding, but you do have some control over the amount. The easiest way to manage how much tax is withheld is through the information you provide on one of the first forms your boss gave you: the W-4."}

The Ford Escape and Thunderbird and Lincoln Blackwood are excluded from the offer, which ends Jan. 14. Let\u2019s face it: a zero-percent financing rate on an auto loan is quite a deal. \u201cThat\u2019s darn good,\u201d says Paul Taylor, chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association. \u201cZero-percent financing is awfully attractive, even compared to 2.9 percent, and it\u2019s certainly attractive compared to the prevailing auto rates at financial institutions.\u201d Of course, keep in mind these deals are available only for those with squeaky-clean credit. Those with lesser credit ratings can still get a good deal, but probably not zero-interest financing. Still, it\u2019s a good opportunity for those with good credit. Let\u2019s look at a $20,000, 36-month auto loan. On a loan with a 7.23 percent interest rate \u2014 the Bankrate.com national average for 36-month auto loans \u2014 you\u2019d pay $2,307.30 in interest over the life of the loan. Even on a loan with a 2.9 percent interest rate, you\u2019d still have to shell out $906.76 in interest. With an interest-free loan, you don\u2019t pay a single penny of interest. Zero-percent financing means you pay zero interest over the life of the loan. You take the $20,000 and divide by 36 to get your monthly payment. That\u2019s easy math \u2014 and quite a deal. Rebates are worth checking\nBut it\u2019s not the only good deal available to car shoppers this fall. Don\u2019t overlook cash rebates. If a rebate is hefty enough, there\u2019s a chance you could save more money by snatching up the cash and financing your loan through a bank or credit union. This calculator from Bankrate.com will help you crunch the numbers. Car shoppers looking for bargains will like what they see. Discount financing and hefty rebates are widespread. It was a good time to buy a car even before the latest wave of interest-free incentives hit. Regardless of where you fall in the credit spectrum, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be able to land a nice financing deal this autumn from a bank or credit union. Auto shoppers of all credit levels catch a break whenever the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Bankrate.com research shows that interest rates on new-car loans tend to shift in lock step with the prime rate. When the Fed cuts rates, the prime rate drops and rates on auto loans from financial institutions soon follow suit. With all the Fed rate cuts so far in 2001, it\u2019s an awfully good time to be shopping for auto financing. It\u2019s a good idea to shop around for financing before you shop for a car. Be sure to check out deals from local banks and credit unions. This Bankrate.com search engine will help you compare car loan rates in your area. Have an auto loan all set to go before you set foot in a dealership. That way if a dealer wants your financing business, he\u2019s going to have to beat the best rate you found on your own. By shopping ahead, you\u2019ll learn what kind of financing deals you qualify for. The dealer won\u2019t be able to talk you into signing on for a loan with a higher interest rate than you deserve. Get the best deal\nBe just as diligent when shopping for the vehicle itself. Intellichoice, Autoweb.com, Edmund\u2019s Automobile Buyers Guide, AutoSite, Autopedia, Kelley Blue Book and CarPrice.com are among the sites offering timely pricing information. Make note of the dates when each rebate is set to expire. Be sure to visit several Web sites when researching pricing information. Everything from sticker price to customer rebate information may vary. It\u2019s wise to cover all the bases. When in doubt, contact an auto manufacturer directly. Here\u2019s one last tip, and it\u2019s an important one. It\u2019s best to think of a new car purchase as three separate negotiations: the price of a car, the price of a trade-in and the financing. A car salesman will try to lump this stuff together. Don\u2019t let him. If you do, you might not notice when the purchase price of the car gets bumped up or the trade-in-value of your old car gets knocked way down. Some dealers might even tell you that you can\u2019t have zero-percent or any discount financing without paying sticker price. Don\u2019t fall for it. Insist on three separate negotiations, and get the best deal you can on each one. Shop as many dealers as necessary to land the deal you want. The best way to land a good deal is to make dealers compete against each other for your business. Be persistent. And keep crunching those numbers. Snapping up a big discount on the price of the car and signing on for a loan from your bank or credit union could be an excellent deal. It could even beat the interest-free, sticker-price-only financing deal that a dealer keeps going on about. Be sure to do the math."}

It was classic and simple from the waist up but ended in an ultra-flared mermaid skirt with a tulle overlay. Gorgeous, and totally worth the wait!Leave it to Kate Moss to pull off one of the most coveted couture looks. Her gown, created by controversial designer John Galliano, was a beautiful bias-cut slip dress with a 1920s and 30s vibe. The bodice was sheer and simple with an illusion neckline, while the skirt was an intricate web of gold beading, embroidering, and over 270,000 sequins. Kate kept up the vintage look by wearing a 1920s style cap veil with floral embroidery\u2014another John Galliano creation.Supermodel Lindsay Ellingson, who wed just a week before fellow Angel Behati Prinsloo, wore an ethereal dress by French designer Sophie Theallet. The stunning pure white gown had a plunging neckline and a romantic draped back with bow details. Lindsay kept the look simple with a classic chignon updo, small heart-shaped earrings, and a sparkly bracelet. Oh, and of course a huge smile! Her wedding to longtime love Sean Clayton was \u201cthe best day of her life.\u201dWhen Behati tied the knot to Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, she wore a custom-made Marchesa dress inspired by the A/W 2011 collection. The bride is rumored to have spent 4 months working on the dress, which featured hand-embroidered blush silk with a tulle skirt, a sleek silhouette, thin spaghetti straps, and a low back. (Behati herself described it as \u201cbohemian, very beachy, very me.\u201d) To cap off the look, she wore a floor-length white silk tulle veil and custom-made white suede Louboutins.The 20-minute ceremony took place at Flora Farms in Los Cabos, Mexico and was officiated by none other than Jonah Hill, Levine\u2019s long-time best friend.Swimsuit model\u200b Chrissy Teigen chose not one, but three Vera Wang gowns for her nuptials to John Legend. For the ceremony, she wore a strapless ivory ball gown with a cutout back and a full princess skirt. Her reception dress was also white and strapless, but had a slimmer fit and a mermaid bottom with a small train. Chrissy changed yet again for the after party, and this time she went all out with a crimson mermaid gown with a skirt resembling rose petals.Chrissy admits she couldn\u2019t help but get carried away with bridal gowns. Every time she went in for a fitting, she came out with another dress!Cindy Crawford doesn\u2019t need a lot to look good. Case in point: Her 1998 nuptials to former model Rande Gerber. She wore a barely-there John Galliano slip dress for her barefoot beach wedding, and her only accessories were her long, tanned legs and her tousled brown locks. It was light, beautiful, and oh-so Cindy.In case you haven\u2019t noticed, models love to hire their designer friends to help them create the dress of their dreams, and Polish model Anja Rubik is no exception. For her wedding to fellow model Sasha Knezevic, she enlisted good pal Peter Dundas, a top Pucci designer. The dress he created was short at the front with a long train in the back and was topped off by a long veil. It was so unforgettable that it was included in London\u2019s 2013 Iconic Wedding Dress Exhibition, alongside the wedding dresses of other top celebrities including Coco Rocha, Joan Collins, Portia de Rossi, and Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie."}

{"title": "Is Military BAH Considered Income?", "text": "The Basic Allowance for Housing, or BAH, is a stipend paid to military service members who do not live in government housing. It's intended to help them afford a place to live. As far as the Internal Revenue Service is concerned, military BAH is not included in gross income, and is not taxable. But there are other contexts in which the allowance may be considered income.\n\nA military man and his family.\n\ncredit: felixmizioznikov/iStock/Getty Images\n\nWhy It's Not Taxable Income\n\nWhen a service member lives in government housing on a military base, the value of that housing is not treated as gross income to the service member. This differs from the civilian world, where employer-provided housing usually counts as a taxable fringe benefit. The military service member doesn't have to report the value of base housing as income on his tax return, and he doesn't have to pay taxes on it. Excluding the BAH from income simply extends this treatment to service members who live off-base. In both cases, the service member's base pay is subject to income tax, but the housing he receives is not -- regardless of whether that housing comes in the form of an actual place to live, or cash to pay for a place to live.\n\nOther Contexts\n\nBeyond tax purposes, a service member's BAH might be considered income, depending on the context. For example, federal courts have ruled that states can include the housing allowance in income when calculating child support obligations. The BAH is included when calculating income to determine eligibility for food stamps, and states are allowed -- but not required -- to use it in determining eligibility for the WIC supplemental nutrition program. When applying for any program, benefit or service whose eligibility hinges on income, it's best for the service member to ask directly whether to include BAH."}
{"title": "Is An Extended Car Loan Right for You?", "text": "An extended car loan is a car loan that lasts over 60 months. Some financial experts would even consider a 60-month car loan extended. Extending a car loan is riddled with higher overall costs for a vehicle. However, it does provide some much-needed payment relief for those who really need it.The dollar amount of a car payment is important when committing to financing a new car. Although, it can be a huge mistake to focus solely on that number verses the overall cost. Many dealerships advertise very low monthly payments so they can sell more cars. What the buyer may not realize is the low payment is either due to a large down payment or an extended loan. Down payments are always recommended on a new car purchase but sometimes it is not possible. No down payment often leaves the buyer with an extended loan as their only way of keeping the payment amount down.Pros of Extended Car LoansSecure a low monthly payment.Yes, that is pretty much it. The lower payment could be a credit score saver to those in need, though. Some people hear it over and over how terrible extended car loans can be. Do you know what is even more terrible? Not being able to make your car payments which can lead to vehicle repossession and a terrible credit score. It is important to buy a vehicle which you can afford. But, sometimes what you can afford won't get you from point A to point B. Some experts might say, you cannot afford a vehicle if you require an extended loan to make the payments. There are certainly risks for borrowers considering an extended loan, but I believe there are much worse things you could do financially than decide on an extended loan. Know the risks and make an informed decision as to whether or not it is right for you and your family.Cons of Extended Car LoansThey almost always come with higher interest rates.You will owe more than what the car is worth for a long period of time.You will need to buy gap insurance to cover the difference between what the car is worth and what you owe.All of the problems with extended car loans add up to paying more overall for a new car purchase. Nobody wants to pay more and with all of these factors it could mean hundreds if not thousands of dollars more. If you cannot pay for a car in 60 months or less, the car is probably out of your price range. Proceed with caution and try to pay more on your monthly payment to pull your self out from underneath the loan.Helpful Car Loan TipsWhat Does It Mean To Be Underwater on a Car LoanHow To Improve Your Chances of Getting a Car LoanHow To Calculate a Loan Payment Let's Connect!

{"title": "How Much Does it Cost to Fix a Flat Tire on a Car?", "text": "Having a flat tire on your car is not only inconvenient but can also be expensive. The cost of fixing your tire varies, depending on the amount of damage done to it and the repair method you choose. In some cases, you'll use a temporary repair before you can fix the tire permanently or replace it.\n\nThe cost of fixing a flat tire depends on the method used and the type of damage.\n\ncredit: JCPJR/iStock/Getty Images\n\nTire Sealants\n\nTire sealants are pressurized sprays that inflate a flat tire while coating the interior surface of the tire with a liquid sealant, which hardens to close holes created by tire punctures. Cans of tire sealant generally retail for around $5, though the price may be higher or lower depending on the size of the can and the brand of sealant. Though sealants are not meant to serve as permanent repairs, they will fix flats sufficiently so that you can drive your car until the tire is permanently repaired.\n\nPatches and Plugs\n\nTire plugs are adhesive-coated inserts that fill puncture holes in a tire, and though they are recommended as temporary repairs, they are often used as long-term solutions for punctures. Patches are rubber or plastic pieces that are glued to the inside of a tire to cover and seal a hole. The two repair methods may be used separately or together, with individual patches or plugs costing between $10 and $15, while a patch and plug combination costs between $25 and $30. Plug kits are also available for car owners to use at home, retailing for between $5 and $10, depending on the kit contents.\n\nTire Replacement\n\nIn some cases, the damage to a tire is too severe to repair, or is located in a portion of the tire that can't be repaired. If this occurs, then the tire must be replaced. The cost of tire replacement varies significantly depending on whether the tire is replaced with a new, used or retreaded tire; the brand name of the tire also heavily influences price. Tire replacement may cost as low as $50 or as much as $200, depending on the tire purchased as a replacement for your damaged tire.\n\nProfessional Repair\n\nThe cost of professional tire repair varies depending on whether the tire is getting plugged, patched or replaced. Tire shops may offer plugs or patch-and-plug combinations as their standard repair option, though liability associated with faulty plug installation may cause some tire shops to avoid repairing tires. Though tire shops charge more for plugs, patches and replacements than you could do the job for at home, they do offer the advantage of balancing the tire afterward to ensure that the repairs haven't changed the balance of the tire on its rim."}
{"title": "Social investment networks the new craze?", "text": "The Internet revolutionized trading in the \u201990s with online trading platforms. Suddenly, everyone could open a brokerage account and trade at any time without calling anybody or sitting through a sales pitch. A decade later, the hive mind of the Internet is buzzing around the idea of social networking for investors.\nSeveral big social investment networks already exist, and more are emerging every day. Investors can message each other and read what others say about trading and investments, but that\u2019s nothing new. There are countless free message boards and forums available for those sorts of services. The hook of social investment networks is the ability to link your account to other traders and have their trades quickly replicated in your account automatically.\nIt sounds like a great deal \u2014 but keep in mind a lot can go wrong when making speculative trades using leverage. Trusting other people to decide how you should trade adds another level of risk to an already uncertain endeavor. Market and trading risk aren\u2019t the only hurdles on the way toward profits; fees could definitely eat into any possible returns. Just so you know: Bankrate doesn\u2019t endorse any of these companies. Social investing networks could be the wave of the future \u2014 or they could be a new-fangled way to lose lots of money.\nTrading in the 21st century\nThough many social investing sites trade the foreign exchange market, or forex, some sites do offer the ability to buy stocks and other investments, and they let investors follow and automatically copy the trades of stock, futures and options traders.\nThe sales pitch essentially says investors no longer need to pick winning investments; they can just copy the trades of people with a history of winning and reap the rewards. But there are a couple of catches. First, buyer beware: Past performance is no indication of future returns. Investors should always do their homework and understand what they\u2019re investing in.\nSecond, these social investment networks generally charge fees. Can individual investors generate enough returns to outstrip the costs of trading? Maybe, but while profits are only hypothetical, fees are certain.\n\u201cLarge costs associated with the services themselves should definitely be the major concern for the investors. One must try the paper-trading accounts for as long as possible and not follow those traders which trade a lot, as this will result in a lot of commissions for the trades executed,\u201d says Arseniy Korobchenko, director of marketing at On Budget and Time Ltd., a financial technology consulting firm.\nPaper-trading accounts are just like real accounts \u2014 but with fake money. The demo accounts let investors test the waters before committing real funds.\nThat\u2019s important because forex brokers are very willing to lend money for trading, enabling investors to use leverage, which amplifies returns as well as losses.\nBeware of borrowing\nLeverage is a double-edged sword. Investors can risk less of their own money upfront but could incur big losses if their trade ends up losing lots of the money they\u2019ve borrowed.\n\u201cThe problem with forex is that it is highly leveraged. When you buy 100 shares of IBM for $10,000, you either put up the money or buy it on margin,\u201d says Tim LuCarelli, chief analyst of FXAddicts.com.\nBy buying on margin, an investor would put up part of the cost to purchase the security and borrow the rest. It\u2019s the same in forex trading, but more widespread.\n\u201cIt is a way of getting more meaningful trading results from forex\u2019s low volatility by making forex trading available to users that wouldn\u2019t have such an opportunity to trade without it,\u201d says George Kollias, publishing director at ZuluTrade.\nInvestors may be lured in by the thought of easy money, but that street goes both ways: Losing it can be just as easy.\nCopycats\nEach social investment network does things a little bit differently, but the basic idea is that investors can interact with one another, peruse news and research, see other people\u2019s trades, and pick traders they want to copy.\nThe fees vary from site to site, as do the ways trade leaders are chosen. On some sites, the leaders apply and go through a vetting process. At least one site, Collective2, allows anyone to set themselves up as a leader, and natural selection takes its course: If they do poorly, they will fall down in the rankings, and no one will follow them.\nEToro was founded in 2007 as an attempt at making trading more fun.\nThe exalted traders on eToro are called social gurus, and anyone can apply to be one as long as they meet the requirements. In addition to trading reasonably well, potential leaders must have a picture of themselves on their profile, share their trading performance and have at least 10 copiers.\nThere are two trading platforms built into the eToro website. One of eToro\u2019s platforms, called OpenBook, lets investors view other investors\u2019 messages and rankings and easily copy trades. The other platform, WebTrader, is similar to typical forex trading platforms with a control center and charts to view.\nAccount minimum\nThe minimum to get started is $50, but it depends on the method you use for funding. The minimum to fund the account with a credit card is $50, while the minimum for a bank wire is $500.\nTypes of investments available\nThough investors do have the option to buy some stocks through eToro, they don\u2019t actually own the stock after making the purchase \u2014 a drawback, since they have no shareholder rights or ownership stake in the company. Instead, the purchase is of a \u201ccontract for differences,\u201d or CFD. A CFD is a derivative contract; the underlying security is not traded. Instead, investors speculate on the future price of the asset.\nWhen you buy a stock through the eToro account, the company agrees to pay you the difference between the price at which the security was bought and sold when you close the position. One benefit of their system is that you can buy as little as you like \u2014 for instance, a fraction of a share.\nThere\u2019s a small transaction cost for purchasing one of the handful of stocks available on the site. Investors can also buy contracts for differences on commodities as well as some of the larger stock indexes from the U.S. and Europe, including Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, the Nasdaq 100 and Germany\u2019s Dax 30 index, among others.\nHow much does it cost?\nThere\u2019s no cost to use the service, but there is a cost per trade. EToro charges a fixed spread between the price a seller can get for selling his asset and the price at which you can buy it, called the bid and the ask.\n\u201cThere is a fixed spread; we don\u2019t believe in dynamic spreads. It\u2019s a fixed commission per instrument. Some instruments are very volatile, and the instruments that are more liquid, the commission is lower,\u201d says Alon Levitan, head of product marketing at eToro.\nRisk management\nTo protect investors from themselves, eToro restricts the amount of money investors can devote to any one trade or trader.\n\u201cYou cannot put more than 20 percent of your balance on any one trader, and never at one time put more than 20 percent of your balance into one single position,\u201d Levitan says.\nOn other social investment networks profiled here, such as eToro and ZuluTrade, investors can try out strategies on demo accounts before signing up. But on Currensee, \u201clookie-loos\u201d are locked out unless you sign up for an account with one of its brokerage partners.\nWhat makes Currensee, founded in 2008, a bit different from other social investment networks is the proprietary trade leader selection process. Instead of letting just anyone in the trade leader door, Currensee handpicks their traders.\n\u201cWe find foreign currency traders, professionals, anywhere in the world. We find them and analyze their performance. We vet them essentially the same way that hedge funds would vet traders for themselves. They go through our analysis, and if we deem them suitable, we present them on the Internet on the leaderboard to customers,\u201d says Dave Lemont, CEO of Currensee.\nAccount minimum\nInvestors must deposit $5,000 to start, and there are minimum capital requirements for trade leaders \u201cto ensure that you are not over-leveraged,\u201d according to the Currensee website.\n\u201cWe suggest a minimum account size of $5,000 or equivalent to allow for reasonable diversification of leaders in your portfolio. Individual trade leaders have minimum allocations from $1,000 up to $6,000, so you may need more capital to invest in some leaders or to construct certain portfolios of leaders,\u201d says David Karp, vice president of marketing with Currensee.\nTypes of investments available\nCurrensee limits itself to investments within the forex market.\nHow much does it cost?\nOn a monthly basis, investors pay a 2 percent annualized fee on assets. Plus they fork over a success fee of 20 percent of profits per month per trader. If you have no profits, you don\u2019t pay a success fee.\n\u201cIn general, 15 percent of the success fee goes to the trade leader, while 5 percent goes to Currensee \u2014 but the deals vary among trade leaders,\u201d Karp says.\nRisk management\nInvestors have a few levers for controlling risk. The maximum drawdown can be set, leverage capped and currency pairs can be limited.\n\u201cThese controls are available to clients on a per-trade leader basis,\u201d says Karp.\nSetting your maximum drawdown allows you to stipulate the lowest you want your account to dip from either the account\u2019s high watermark or from your initial investment in that trade leader. It is expressed in percentage terms. Investors can also decide which currency pairs they are comfortable trading.\nZuluTrade was founded in 2006. Like the other sites, the website has an easy-to-read dashboard that shows the traders available to be followed, known as signal providers. Investors can compare them based on statistics such as return on investment, maximum drawdown, the number of dollars following them and number of followers.\nZuluTrade provides the framework for following signal providers, but investors must sign up for an account with one of the brokerage partners.\nAccount minimum\nThe minimum account balance varies between brokers, but the ZuluTrade website recommends a $15,000 minimum for standard accounts and $500 for mini accounts.\nTypes of investments available\nOnly currencies through forex are traded on ZuluTrade.\nHow much does it cost?\n\u201cThere is no cost for investors for using ZuluTrade. It is totally free,\u201d says Kollias. \u201cZuluTrade is compensated by the collaborating brokers.\u201d The trading costs and commissions vary among currency pairs traded and from broker to broker.\nInvestors don\u2019t have to worry about paying the signal providers either. They are compensated by ZuluTrade. \u201cSignal providers are compensated by ZuluTrade for each traded lot that is copied on a follower\u2019s account, with the exception of the U.S., where signal providers are compensated on a variable monthly membership fee scheme,\u201d Kollias says.\nRisk management\nZuluGuard, the proprietary risk management system, monitors the trading behavior of the trade leaders. If a trade leader abruptly changes their trading patterns or just performs really terribly, ZuluGuard closes the open positions following that signal provider, takes that trader out of the investor\u2019s list and replaces it with another one.\nThere\u2019s also a risk meter bar that illustrates the amount of leverage used. By moving the bar, investors can allocate the number of contracts to trade with each signal provider. It indicates the amount of capital that will be at risk in the worst-case scenario based on the historical data of the trade leader.\n\u201cIn other words, the risk meter bar calculates the worst past performance of the trader that the user has chosen to follow and by comparing this to the user\u2019s settings and equity, shows the maximum amount of the user\u2019s equity that will be at risk should this performance occur again,\u201d Kollias says.\nUnlike the other networks profiled, Collective2 is a marketplace for signal providers. Anyone can come up with a trading system and hang a shingle as someone to be followed. Investors can have trades automatically replicated in brokerage accounts, but they have to license the software to do so, which means more fees.\n\u201cThe end result of having an open platform where anyone all over the world can submit their strategy and be a \u2018signal provider\u2019 in our lingo: You get thousands and thousands of really bad strategies,\u201d says Matthew Klein, founder and president of Collective2.\n\u201cAny open platform, whether it\u2019s investing platforms or \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d the reality is that out of those thousands who submit, 950 are terrible. What\u2019s great about having the software that Collective2 has, you can just discard them,\u201d Klein says.\nThe signal providers are ranked, with the best performers highlighted for investors.\nAccount minimums\nCollective2 has no minimum investment \u201cother than common sense,\u201d says Klein. \u201cFor example, you wouldn\u2019t want to autotrade a system in which you expect a drawdown that is higher than the amount you plan to invest.\u201d\nCollective2 does offer simulated brokerage accounts to try out autotrading, but the individual signal providers set the availability of free trials for their systems. More than 50 percent of the signal providers offer free trials, according to Klein.\nTypes of investments available\nOn Collective2, investors sign up with brokers that are compatible with the site and can follow currency, stock, options and futures traders.\nHow much does it cost?\nWith a wide array of brokers and instruments traded, fees are all over the place. For instance, Collective2-compatible forex brokers may charge no commission; they earn money from the spread between the bid and ask. The trading commission for futures contracts varies, and the commission for stocks is between $1 per order and $5 per trade. Options contracts vary between $0.75 per contract to $0.95 per contract, with a $2.50 minimum.\nThe fee for the autotrading license varies among instruments. For forex, it\u2019s $1 per minilot traded. A footnote tells us that means the fee is charged per 10,000 currency units traded. The fee is charged after the security is sold.\nAutotrading costs $1.99 per futures contract, and there is a flat $99-per-month fee for stocks and options.\nAlso, the individual vendors or signal providers set their own fees. \u201cIt\u2019s not Collective2 that decides what you pay; they typically charge a monthly fee,\u201d says Klein. \u201cMaybe $100 a month for a strategy, sometimes less. People just introducing themselves to the site may charge $10 a month.\u201d\nRisk management\nCollective2 goes to great lengths to stress the importance of risk management and the pitfalls of autotrading. Every time investors start a session on Collective2, they get a big warning screen that reviews the dangers and underscores that results are hypothetical.\nThe platform emphasizes that the results of individual investors will likely vary somewhat from the signal provider; that\u2019s why everything is labeled as hypothetical. (Even the photographs of the employees at Collective2 are deemed hypothetical; Klein bears a striking resemblance to George Clooney, for instance.)\nThere are a few reasons why results and statistics are hypothetical rather than actual, according to Klein.\n\u201cThe hypothetical results Collective2 shows are based on real-life results \u2014 they\u2019re not imaginary. For example, if you see within a trading record on Collective2 that, for example, the system \u2018bought at price 123.45,\u2019 that price will actually be determined as follows: by taking the volume-weighted average price of the actual prices received in real-life brokerage accounts,\u201d he says.\nYour mileage can vary for other reasons as well, including slippage, or the change in price between the time the signal provider executes the trade and the followers receive it.\nMore From Bankrate"}
{"title": "After The CARD Act Should Your Business Switch to Personal Cards?", "text": "Aw nerds! Looks like this page may be out of date. Head over to our Business Credit Cards page for updated info.\nI recently wrote an article for the Forbes Moneybuilder blog about so-called \u201cprofessional\u201d credit cards. According to Marketwatch and the WSJ, credit card issuers have been sending business credit card solicitations to consumers who normally wouldn\u2019t qualify, since these cards don\u2019t fall under the consumer protections of the CARD Act.\nBut where everyone else sees fraud and deceit, I see opportunity. If card companies have relaxed the standards on some business credit cards, that means that savvy credit card users may be able to take advantage of business credit cards with exceptional rewards, like the Ink Cash from Chase, or the Costco TrueEarnings for Business.\nThere\u2019s another side to the debate, however. If you\u2019re a small business owner that uses credit cards for financing or to better manage cash flow, then you\u2019re probably a bit more concerned about the interest rates and fees. And in this case, the CARD Act should save you a lot of money, except that it doesn\u2019t apply to business credit cards. So maybe it\u2019s time you consider switching to a personal credit card to use for your business expenses.\nPersonal credit cards for your business\nIf your business requires you to carry a balance, you want a card with a low ongoing APR. Another benefit of using a personal card here is that business cards usually have higher APRs anyway."}
{"title": "What Are Employee Referral Bonuses?", "text": "Companies seeking talent often devise an incentive system whereby current employees are rewarded with a referral bonus if they recommend a candidate who is ultimately hired.A few employers award bonuses for viable referrals that don't result in a hire. However, most employers require incentive hires to remain with the firm for at least a few months before paying the bonus to the employee who referred the new hire.Companies Offering BonusesAccording to the Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM), roughly 1 of every 2 employers offers a formal referral bonus program. Such programs account for close to 25% of all hires, on average. Many other employers have an informal referral system.At some companies, such programs cover any job. In other cases, bonuses are restricted to positions with an insufficient supply of talent \u2013 for example, an e-commerce company might provide bonuses for software engineers, especially if they're in a competitive market for tech talent, but not other roles that are easier to fill. The United States government even offers an employee referral bonus program at the discretion of individual agencies to staff hard-to-fill jobs.It's important to note that the roles selected for bonus programs aren't inherently more valuable than non-bonus eligible roles; often, they're just harder to fill. So if your job title doesn't make the cut, don't feel undervalued. (But do, perhaps, go through your own network and see if you have connections to refer for these in-demand jobs.)Why Companies Pay BonusesEmployers often believe that accessing the social networks of current staff can be more cost-effective than other recruiting techniques, including the use of executive recruitment services. Some research indicates that incentive programs yield a higher quality employee and enhance retention of staff.In any case, referral programs are a good way of building a sense of community and teamwork. It's in employees' best interests to recommend potential colleagues that are skilled, responsible, creative workers. No bonus is worth the social fallout from making a bad referral (especially if the referrer in question has to work directly with a less-than-stellar candidate).When Should You Refer a Contact?With this in mind, it's important to screen your contacts carefully before passing their resume along to human resources. Before making a potential connection, ask yourself:1. Is this person qualified for the role? Look at the job description and at your contact's resume. Do you see overlap? Does your friend have the relevant experience, education, and skills? If they were a stranger, would you see them as a viable candidate?2. Are they interested in the position? This might sound obvious, but if the potential candidate isn't enthused about the opportunity, he or she shouldn't be pushed to take it. You burn social capital every time you make a recommendation that doesn't work out. Don't set yourself up to lose by trying to force a fit that doesn't exist.3. Would you want to work with them? Even if you wouldn't be working directly with your connection in the new role, it's only fair to ask yourself if you'd want to do so. If not, why would you subject your current colleagues to the experience?Finally, once you've made the referral, your role in the interaction is finished. Don't follow up on your friend's behalf or put pressure on the hiring manager to select your candidate. At best, you'll make your connection look like someone who's not able to fight their own battles; at worst, you'll come off as less than professional and possibly stalkerish. Neither scenario will help your friend get hired, or you get that bonus.Employee Bonus AmountsIncentives vary greatly by company, with cash, gift certificates, trips and even cars being awarded. The value of incentives ranges from $250 to more than $25,000 (for executive positions) with the most common range being about $1000 - $2500 according to a survey by WorldatWork.Bonus payments were made in a lump sum about 70% of the time, on average. In other cases, a partial initial payment was made with the remainder awarded at a later date (often after one year).If a company has an employee referral program, company policy will determine the guidelines including how to refer a prospective employee, the amount of bonuses, eligibility, and payment."}
{"title": "Debt-to-Income Ratio Matters When You\u2019re Buying a House", "text": "Your debt-to-income ratio plays a large role in whether you\u2019re ready and able to qualify for a mortgage. This figure, the percentage of your income that goes toward paying your monthly debts, helps lenders figure out how big a monthly mortgage payment you can handle. It\u2019s as important as your credit score and job stability, if not more so.\nLenders calculate your debt-to-income ratio by dividing your monthly debt obligations by your pretax, or gross, income. Most lenders look for a ratio of 36% or less, though there are exceptions, which we\u2019ll get into below.\nThis ratio, known in the mortgage industry as a DTI, helps you answer the question, \u201cHow much house can I afford?\u201d and is a useful guide for mortgage lenders trying to figure out how much you can borrow. But your DTI is not the whole story \u2014 it leaves out unavoidable monthly expenses such as food, utilities, transportation costs and health insurance, among others. It\u2019s important to keep those obligations in mind as you evaluate your ability to afford a home.\nHere\u2019s how DTIs work.\nTwo types of ratios\nThere are two kinds of debt-to-income ratios:\nThe front-end ratio , also known as a household ratio, is the dollar amount of your home-related expenses \u2014 your proposed monthly mortgage, property tax, insurance and homeowners association fees \u2014 divided by your monthly gross income.\n, also known as a household ratio, is the dollar amount of your home-related expenses \u2014 your proposed monthly mortgage, property tax, insurance and homeowners association fees \u2014 divided by your monthly gross income. The back-end ratio includes all the other debts you pay each month \u2014 such as credit cards, student loans, personal loans and car loans \u2014 in addition to proposed household expenses. Back-end ratios tend to be slightly higher, since they take into account all of your monthly debt obligations.\nWhich one matters more?\nWhile mortgage lenders typically look at both types of DTI, the back-end ratio often holds more sway because it takes into account your entire debt load.\nLenders tend to focus on the back-end ratio for conventional mortgages, loans that are offered by banks or online mortgage lenders rather than a government program. If your front-end DTI is below 28%, that\u2019s great. If your back-end DTI is below 36%, that\u2019s even better.\nWhen you\u2019re applying for a nonconventional mortgage, like an FHA loan, lenders will look at both ratios and will consider DTIs that are higher than those required for a conventional mortgage: up to 31% for the front end and 43% for the back end. Sometimes lenders will even allow the ratios to go slightly higher.\nIdeally, though, you\u2019ll want DTIs that are as low as possible, regardless of the lender\u2019s limits. A lower DTI will help your credit score, which will in turn allow you to get a lower mortgage interest rate.\nThink beyond your DTIs\nAlthough DTIs are important in getting a mortgage, they\u2019re not enough when it comes to helping you figure out what you can afford, says Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.\n\u201cYou can have these general guidelines around debt-to-income ratio,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the bigger question is, will you, once you have that mortgage payment, have sufficient money to make ends meet?\u201d\nSince DTIs don\u2019t take into account expenses such as food, health insurance, utilities, gasoline and entertainment, you\u2019ll want to budget beyond what your DTI labels \u201caffordable.\u201d Aiming below the 36% back-end target is ideal.\nThis is especially important since your DTIs count your income before taxes, not what you actually take home each month.\nHow to lower your DTI\nThe higher your DTI, the more likely you are to struggle to make your monthly mortgage payments. You\u2019ll want to lower your DTI not just to qualify for a mortgage and buy the home you want, but also to ensure you\u2019re able to pay all your debts and live comfortably at the same time.\nThere are several ways to lower your debt-to-income ratio:\nAvoid taking on more debt.\nDon\u2019t make any big purchases on credit before you buy a home.\nTry to pay off as much of your current debt as possible before you apply for a mortgage.\n\u201cThe best thing homebuyers can do is pay down or pay off high-interest credit card and consumer debt,\u201d says Chris Hiestand, director of marketing at Lenda, an online lending company. \u201cDoing this will improve the back-end ratio and will also boost their credit score. DTI ratios actually don\u2019t impact the mortgage interest rate, but credit scores have a big impact on interest rates.\u201d\nWhile a pay raise at work is another way to lower your DTI, it\u2019s not safe to rely on something that might not happen. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better to avoid taking on more debt and work on whittling down the debt you have.\nIn most cases, lenders won\u2019t include installment debts like car or student loan payments as part of your DTI if you have just a few months left to pay them off.\nOne last point\nIf your debt-to-income ratio is exceptionally high \u2014 say 50% or more \u2014 you probably should wait on a home purchase.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, \u2018I need to wait another year before I buy a house,\u2019\u201d Rheingold says. He suggests getting your finances in order first so that you present yourself as someone with good credit and not a lot of overhanging debt.\nBefore you sit down with a lender, using a home loan calculator is one way to figure out how much house you can afford.\nThe lower your debt-to-income ratio, the safer you are to lenders \u2014 and the better your finances will be."}
{"title": "Work for the Federal Government? Try these Credit Unions", "text": "Credit unions are great options for your banking needs. Typically smaller than big banks, they often offer great customer service, lower interest rates on loans, lower bank fees, and higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts. What\u2019s more, they offer many of the same products and services as the nation\u2019s largest banks.There's a catch, of course, in that you have to be eligible for membership in order to set up an account. Fortunately, many credit unions have relaxed membership requirements in recent years. Especially if you work for the federal government, you\u2019ve got several options available.If you aren\u2019t physically located near any of the credit unions below \u2013 don\u2019t worry. They might still serve your needs. When credit unions are part of the shared branching network, you can access your account from thousands of credit unions across the country (visiting the branch of another credit union to make deposits, withdrawals, get cashier\u2019s checks, and more).No matter which credit union you choose, make sure your deposits are insured by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government for maximum protection. Federally insured credit unions meet this requirement.The financial institutions below are great options for employees of the federal government and the military (including family members). They get very good reviews from satisfied customers, and they offer competitive products.Pentagon Federal Credit UnionThe Pentagon Federal Credit Union or \"PenFed\" basically allows anyone to join. If you're a member of the military, a US Government employee, an employee at an \"eligible place of business\" or an American Red Cross employee/volunteer, you can join.Don't fit into one of the categories? Don't worry. Family members of any of the above can join, too. If all else fails, the bank allows membership for those who belong to the National Military Family Association or the Voices for America's Troops Foundation, available for a $14 one-time fee to any US citizen \u2013 you can join this organization when you open your PenFed account online. Pentagon Federal's options for banking and lending are extensive, and the credit union offers some great online banking features to boot.Navy Federal Credit UnionNavy Federal serves the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Airforce and Department of Defense. To join, applicants must work for one of these organizations or be a family member of an eligible employee. While most credit unions extend memberships to immediate family only, Navy Federal allows grandparents and grandchildren to become members. If either of the above requirements fits your situation, take advantage of Navy Federal's great rates on everything from car loans to fixed interest credit cards.Fortune magazine ranked it one of the best places to work in 2008, and membership is at over six million and growing. In early 2011, Navy Federal merged with the USA Federal Credit Union.One extra perk of Navy Federal is 24/7 phone support. PenFed also has generous customer service hours, but Navy Federal comes out ahead if you\u2019re a night owl.Opening a Credit Union AccountTo open an account at a credit union, you\u2019ll need to qualify as a member, as described above. In some cases, that\u2019s as easy as making a donation to an organization associated with the credit union (you become a member of the organization by donating, and that makes you eligible to become a credit union member as well).Next, you\u2019ll need to provide basic information about yourself, such as your Social Security Number, physical address, and a valid government identification document.Finally, you\u2019ll open a \u201cshare\u201d account, which officially makes you a member. In many cases, this means you have to deposit between $5 and $20 (which the credit union will set aside) for the duration of your membership.Banks for Government EmployeesCredit unions aren\u2019t always better than banks (although both types of institutions often offer the same types of products and services). Shop around to make sure you get the right fit for your needs. Although most banks accept anybody as a customer, there are exceptions. USAA Bank is popular among military families, and the bank consistently gets good reviews for customer service and competitive rates. Joining USAA requires that you are active military, former military, cadets or midshipmen, or family of those individuals.Note: this article was updated by Justin Pritchard."}
{"title": "Debt Financing vs. Equity Financing: Building Your Business", "text": "When you decide to start a small business, one of your first questions is likely to be how to raise money to finance your business operations. No matter how you plan to obtain financing for your business, you need to spend some time developing a business plan. Only then should you go forward with financing plans for even a simple small business.Equity FinancingYou may have some cash you want to put into the business yourself, so that will be your initial base. Maybe you also have family or friends who are interested in your business idea and they would like to invest in your business. That may sound good on the surface to you, but even if this is the best arrangement for you, there are factors you must consider before you jump in. If you decide to accept investments from family and friends, you will be using a form of financing called equity financing.One thing that you want to be clear about is whether your family and friends want to invest in your business or loan you some money for your business. That is a crucial distinction! If they want to invest, then they are offering you equity financing. If they want to loan you money for your business, then that is quite different and is actually considered debt financing.Advantages of Equity Financing:You can use your cash and that of your investors when you start up your business for all the start-up costs, instead of making large loan payments to banks or other organizations or individuals. You can get underway without the burden of debt on your back.If you have prepared a prospectus for your investors and explained to them that their money is at risk in your brand new start-up business, they will understand that if your business fails, they will not get their money back.Depending on who your investors are, they may offer valuable business assistance that you may not have. This can be important, especially in the early days of a new firm. You may want to consider angel investors or venture capital funding. Choose your investors wisely!Disadvantages of Equity Financing:Remember that your investors will actually own a piece of your business; how large that piece is depends on how much money they invest. You probably will not want to give up control of your business, so you have to be aware of that when you agree to take on investors. Investors do expect a share of the profits where, if you obtain debt financing, banks or individuals only expect their loans repaid. If you do not make a profit during the first years of your business, then investors don't expect to be paid and you don't have the monkey on your back of paying back loans.Since your investors own a piece of your business, you are expected to act in their best interests as well as your own, or you could open yourself up to a lawsuit. In some cases, if you make your firm's securities available to just a few investors, you may not have to get into a lot of paperwork, but if you open yourself up to wide public trading, the paperwork may overwhelm you. You will need to check with the Securities and Exchange Commission to see the requirements before you make decisions on how widely you want to open up your business for investment.Debt FinancingIf you decide that you do not want to take on investors and want total control of the business yourself, you may want to pursue debt financing in order to start up your business. You will probably try to tap your own sources of funds first by using personal loans, home equity loans, and even credit cards. Perhaps family or friends would be willing to loan you the necessary funds at lower interest rates and better repayment terms. Applying for a business loan is another option.Advantages of Debt FinancingDebt financing allows you to have control of your own destiny regarding your business. You do not have investors or partners to answer to and you can make all the decisions. You own all the profit you make.If you finance your business using debt, the interest you repay on your loan is tax-deductible. This means that it shields part of your business income from taxes and lowers your tax liability every year. Your interest is usually based on the prime interest rate.The lender(s) from whom you borrow money do not share in your profits. All you have to do is make your loan payments in a timely manner.You can apply for a Small Business Administration loan that has more favorable terms for small businesses than traditional commercial bank loans.Disadvantages of Debt FinancingThe disadvantages of borrowing money for a small business may be great. You may have large loan payments at precisely the time you need funds for start-up costs. If you don't make loan payments on time to credit cards or commercial banks, you can ruin your credit rating and make borrowing in the future difficult or impossible. If you don't make your loan payments on time to family and friends, you can strain those relationships.For a new business, commercial banks may require you to pledge your personal assets before they will give you a loan. If your business goes under, you will lose your personal assets.Any time you use debt financing, you are running the risk of bankruptcy. The more debt financing you use, the higher the risk of bankruptcy. Calculate the debt to equity ratio to determine how much debt your firm is in compared to its equity.Some will tell you that if you incorporate your business, your personal assets are safe. Don't be so sure of this. Even if you incorporate, most financial institutions will still require a new business to pledge business or personal assets as collateral for your business loans. You can still lose your personal assets.Which is best; debt or equity financing? It depends on the situation. Your financial capital, potential investors, credit standing, business plan, tax situation, the tax situation of your investors, and the type of business you plan to start all have an impact on that decision. The mix of debt and equity financing that you use will determine your cost of capital for your business.Two More Traditional Sources of Capital for your BusinessBesides debt and equity financing, there are two other traditional sources of capital for your business. Operating revenue and the sale of assets can also generate money for your firm.Make your financing decisions wisely!"}
{"title": "Basic Tips for Negotiating Freight Contracts", "text": "How often does your company ship product? If you require the carrier to show up to your dock daily, the cost will be different than if your requirements call for once a week pick-up.How much tonnage do you ship? Provide the carrier annual numbers as well as averages per week. The best way to obtain these numbers is to take the prior year's shipping numbers and add or subtract business (according to gains and losses).What are you paying your current carrier? Often times when it comes to negotiating freight contracts, it is a carrier who has reached out to the shipper seeking business. When the shipper provides copies of their current carrier's invoices, it is an incentive for the new carrier to provide a deeper discount in order to land the business.How quickly do you pay your bills? Simply telling a carrier how quickly you pay is not sufficient for good negotiating tactics. The best option is to show proof of payment. Do not show just one payment, but rather at least six months worth of invoices and payments.What is your shipping schedule? On which day/days of the week do you primarily ship? Are you flexible on the time of day you ship? That may be a key negotiating tactic. If you can adapt to the carrier's schedule it gives you room to negotiate a lower shipping cost.Where do you ship? If you are moving your product across town, it will be less expensive than shipping across country. Across country will be less expensive than internationally. If you ship to multiple locations then you will need to decide if you want to set up a single zone rate or a multi-zone rate. A single zone rate is practical if you ship to the same destination all the time. This rate is also practical if you ship primarily close to your home location. A multi-zone rate is more practical if you ship throughout the U.S. on a regular basis.lar basis.How much tonnage do you ship per destination? How much tonnage you ship will directly affect the cost of freight.What is your specific freight description? What freight class ratings do you ship? Are hazardous materials involved? Will freight be pre-paid or collect? If you primarily ship less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments, try to seek a freight-all-kinds (FAK) rating. This will save money in the end if you ship a wide variety of classifications. It also makes the invoice auditing process easier.Once you have all your data together, you may either set up a face-to-face meeting with the carrier or send out Requests for Proposals (RFP) (also known as Requests for Quotes or RFQs). Face-to-face meetings are fine, but RFPs are more productive. RFPs give you a chance to review everyone's proposal and make a chart of what they are offering. The chart will help you easily compare who will give you what for how much."}
{"title": "Learn About the Now-Defunct Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)", "text": "The Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) was a database that was maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA). The list identified suppliers and vendors excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits. The EPLS also issued any administrative and statutory exclusions across the entire government, and individuals barred from entering the United States.The EPLS was replaced on November 21, 2012, by the System for Award Management (SAM). SAM combined federal procurement system, and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance into one new system.Original Purpose of the EPLSThe General Services Administration (GSA) launched the EPLS in January 2007. The system was to contain information entered by Federal agencies that identified individuals and businesses excluded from Federal Government procurement and non-procurement programs and the applicable authority for the exclusion.Due to its web-based interface, EPLS was easy to use and allowed ad hoc searches, and report capabilities. It also made possible integration with the Central Contractor Registration system to allow Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) numbers to be used.There were five categories of individuals and businesses covered by the EPLS system:Individuals excluded or disqualified under a Federal agency's codification of the Common Rules on Non-procurement suspension and debarment, or otherwise declared ineligible from receiving certain Federal assistance and/or benefits.Individuals debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or otherwise declared ineligible from participating in Federal procurement programs.Individuals barred or suspended from acting as sureties for bid and performance bond activity in procurement programs.Individuals barred from entering the United States.Individuals that may be subject to sanctions with regards to 31 CFR Parts 500-599 and any relevant sub-parts.Users of the EPLSThe GSA identified a number of specific users of the EPLS and the subsequent System for Award Management (SAM) application. These included:Contracting officers and other Federal, State, and local government employees involved in procuring goods and servicesFederal, State, local, or foreign agency responsible for prosecuting, enforcing, or carrying out a statute, rule, regulation, or order where the records clearly indicate a violation of civil or criminal law or regulation.Federal, State or local agency, financial institution or a healthcare or industry provider that administers assistance programs or benefits, when the information is needed to determine eligibility.To a formal complaints examiner, an equal employment opportunity investigator, an arbitrator, or union representative, investigating or settling a grievance, complaint, or appeal filed by an employee, when the information is needed to decide the issues.To a requesting Federal, State or local agency, financial institution, or a healthcare or industry provider in connection with hiring or retaining an employee or issuing a security clearance.Errors on the DatabaseBefore a record was placed on the EPLS database, the individual or business concerned would be informed that their names would be contained in the EPLS. That notification came from the agency that took the action to exclude them from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs. If any individual or business wished to contest the record being placed on the EPLS, then they had to contact the agency who took the action.Issues with the EPLSThe US Government Accountability Office (GAO) undertook a study of the EPLS in 2009. The reason for the study was to investigate allegations that had indicated that excluded parties on the EPLS had been able to receive federal contracts.As a result, the GAO was asked to determine whether these allegations could be substantiated and to identify the key causes of any improper awards and other payments detected.The 2009 report found that:A number of suppliers who had been excluded for offenses such as national security violations and tax fraud were still received funding for a number of reasons. These included failure on the part of agency officials to search the EPLS or search errors which did not reveal the exclusions.Businesses and individuals that were able to circumvent the terms of their exclusions by operating under different identities.Most of the improper payments made were attributed to ineffective management of the EPLS database, or to control weaknesses at both excluding and procuring agencies.No single agency was monitoring the content or function of the database and that agencies were not consistently inputting timely or accurate data related to the parties they excluded.EPLS entries contained incomplete information, the database had insufficient search capabilities, and the listed points of contact for further information about exclusions were incorrect.Partly due to the GAO report, the EPLS was replaced by the System for Award Management (SAM)."}
{"title": "How to Get Your Tax Withholding Just Right", "text": "After finishing up your tax return, it's a smart idea to do a little planning ahead for next year. Your income or deductions may be changing, and you may want to adjust your withholding to avoid having too large of a refund or a significant balance due. Finding just the right level of withholding can be tricky, especially if you anticipate significant changes to your income or deductions.Disregarding Your Withholding Can Be TaxingCalculating a level of withholding that is \"just right\" can sometimes take as much time as preparing a tax return. As a result, some people are inclined the skip the math. For those who want to keep things as simple as possible, the easiest course of action is for taxpayers to claim either Single or Married with one withholding allowance on Form W-4 (pdf). This usually results in a refund for most people. However, there are situations in which claiming one withholding allowance is not sufficient to cover tax liabilities. This seems to be the case in which a person has significant investment income or higher taxes due to the Alternative Minimum Tax. So even people who want to keep things simple and count on a refund should review their withholding at least periodically.Calculating Withholding More AccuratelyThe more accurate way to adjust your withholding is to create a projected tax return for this year. You can do this by using the same tax forms you used last year, but substitute the current tax rates. For example, you could calculate your income and deductions based on what you expect for 2016, and use the 2016 tax rates to find out what your projected tax will be. You can also use the worksheet found in Form 1040-ES (pdf), which has formulas for calculating taxes for the current tax year.After figuring out the tax liability, I then use the withholding calculator found on the IRS Web site to see what the suggested withholding allowances might be. You can also do the math by hand by using the worksheets provided with Form W-4.What's a Withholding Allowance?Withholding allowances do not solely pertain to dependents or to the personal exemption amount, though withholding allowances are related. A withholding allowance is a way for your payroll department to use the look-up tables provided by the IRS to figure out how much tax to withhold from each paycheck. A withholding allowance represents your total tax deductions divided by the personal exemption amount. This results in a ratio, and this ratio is how many withholding allowances you should claim. For further explanation please refer to the example below:Example: Mary is a single parent, qualifies as head of household, and has one dependent. Let's further assume that her deductions consist of the standard deduction and two personal exemptions (one for herself and one for her child). The math for her withholding allowances would look like this (all figures below are for the 2016 tax year):Standard deduction: 9,300Personal exemptions: 2 x 4,050 = 8,100Total tax deductions: 9,300 + 8,100 = 17,400Deductions divided by one personal exemption amount: 17,400 / 4,050 = 4.296In this example, Mary would claim Single and four withholding allowances on her W-4 Form. (It's advisable to round down the ratio to avoid having too little tax withheld from your paycheck.) In other words, Mary would check the Single box on line 3 of the Form W-4 and would write \"4\" on line 5 of the Form W-4 where it asks for \"Total number of allowances you are claiming.\"This is a simplified method for finding withholding allowances. For a longer method, see the document, How to Fill out Form W-4.Seeing How Your New Withholding Allowances Will Impact Your Future Pay ChecksNow that you have figured out your withholding allowances, you can use this figure to see what the tax impact is on your next paycheck will be. You just take the newly calculated withholding allowances and plug them into a payroll calculator. Be sure to have your recent paystub handy so you can use your actual income amounts.Calculating Your Total Withholding for the YearTo see what your total withholding will be for the entire year, take your new withholding amount per pay period and multiply this by the number of pay periods that are remaining in the year. To this figure add in how much federal income tax has already been withheld so far for the year-to-date. This amount represents approximately how much total federal tax will be withheld from your paycheck for the year. You can now compare your total withholding to your tax liability projection. If your withholding amount is larger than your tax liability, that's how much of a federal tax refund you might be receiving. If your withholding is smaller than your tax liability, that's how much federal tax you might have to pay when you file your tax return. Remember, these amounts are approximations.If the withholding is too high or too low, go back to the payroll calculator to fiddle with the withholding allowances. Try Single instead of Married, or try changing the withholding allowances by one point at a time. (For example if you used Single-4 the first time, try a new calculation with Single-3.) Re-extrapolate the annual numbers and compare.Repeat this process until you find the withholding level that will be just right for you. I try to get the withholding to produce a refund in the range of $500 to $1,000, figuring that gives my clients enough room so that any changes in income or deductions will not result in owing very much.I find it's best to keep track of all of this math on a spreadsheet. This makes it easier to build alternate scenarios and projections. A spreadsheet also makes it easier to analyze the impact of changing your tax withholding mid-year (which is when most people make these sorts of changes).You can do the same projections with your state taxes as well."}
{"title": "5 Ways to Protect Your Online Reputation", "text": "In today\u2019s world, your reputation and identity in the online marketplace can make or break your business. Whether the information is true or false, who you are in the online community has become reality in the business world. Attorneys especially need to be aware of what information exists about them since many lawyers use referrals as a big part of client intake. In order to keep your reputation intact, it is important to know what\u2019s being said about you. Here are five things you can do to ensure your online reputation is not costing you clients and damaging your reputation.1.  Check search engines at least once a month.It\u2019s not enough to search your business every year (or even every few months) anymore. Customers are writing about companies in record numbers on online review sites, in blogs and in social media. In order to find out what people are saying about you, do a search for you business on all the major search engines. Also, check industry-related community websites for mentions that may not show up on a major search engine but are still relevant to your customer base. Consider setting up an RSS feed or an automatic alert to help track this information.Google Alerts are a great way to see when your name appears in search engines immediately. To create an alert, go to the Google Alerts homepage and then type in your name in the \u201cCreate an alert about \u2026\u201d box. You can select if you\u2019d like to receive email alerts as your name appears, once a day, or once a week. 2. Claim Your Business ProfileNearly everyone doing business today (including potential clients and customers) rely on the power of the web to find service providers and to gain information. This is why it\u2019s important to claim your business profile across the web and on every social media site. Even if you have no intention of ever using Twitter for business, grab your Twitter handle using your name so no one else can do it. 3.  Have a policy and make someone responsible.Since online chatter is constant, you need to have a consistent process and policy about managing your online reputation. Determine what customer service actions can be taken across all the different channels and make monitoring those channels a part of your company policy. If you work in a BigLaw or larger business environment, designate a person in charge of monitoring online mentions and responding to feedback according to the company policy. This individual should be someone who has a strong working knowledge of social networking.4.  Distribute content.A search of your business name that yields few results can be equally damaging as having several negative reviews. Customers want to trust what they are buying and the company from whom they are buying. Not having information to access may turn off potential buyers. Make sure that you are providing information on your website, social networking sites, and through press releases so people can easily find content. Continually providing information will help your online identity grow and will ultimately improve your search engine results.You can also harness the power of social media to create and share content, and promote yourself as an expert. Answer questions on Twitter and participate in industry-specific LinkedIn Group discussions. When you do create content, be sure to share it on these profiles and Facebook.5. Use a Professional Software Solution to HelpIt may be worth investing in a software solution, such as reputation.com, to help you monitor and clean up your online presence. This service, for example, is an all-in-one platform for online review management, local search visibility, and social media designed for businesses. They also offer a service that allows you to measure your business\u2019s performance against competitors.Knowing what is being said online about you and your company is just as critical as making sure there is enough said. Take the time to conduct regular searches on your business name and make sure you have plenty of positive content online."}
{"title": "Connecticut&#39;s Estate Tax Laws", "text": "The Connecticut taxable estate is the sum of (1) the total value of the decedent\u2019s federal gross estate less allowable deductions other than the deduction for state death taxes; and (2) the aggregate amount of Connecticut taxable gifts made by the decedent during his or her lifetime for all calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2005.If the Connecticut taxable estate as determined above exceeds $2,000,000, then Connecticut estate tax is due and payable on the value of the taxable estate, including the first $2,000,000. Note: For deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2010, and on or before December 31, 2010, the state estate tax exemption was increased from $2,000,000 to $3,500,000.All estates subject to the Connecticut estate tax must file Form CT-706/709, Connecticut Estate and Gift Tax Return, with the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, and also file a copy of Form CT-706/709 with the appropriate Connecticut probate court.Outright transfers to a surviving spouse are not taxable. For married couples who have used AB Trust planning to reduce federal estate taxes, Connecticut estate tax may be due on the B Trust after the first spouse's death. A married decedent's estate is authorized to make an election on Form CT-706/709 to treat the property as marital deduction qualified terminable interest property (\"QTIP\") only for purposes of calculating the Connecticut estate tax (this is called a \"state QTIP election\"). What this means is that if the estate is passing to a surviving spouse through an ABC Trust scheme, then the payment of both Connecticut and federal estate taxes can be deferred until after the death of the surviving spouse.If the sum of the Connecticut taxable estate is $2,000,000 or less for deaths occurring before January 1, 2010, or after January 1, 2011, or $3,500,000 for deaths occurring between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2010, then no Connecticut estate and gift tax return will be due. However, all Connecticut estates must file Form CT-706 NT, Connecticut Estate Tax Return (For Nontaxable Estates), with the appropriate Connecticut district probate court.

{"title": "How to Deal With Difficult People at Work", "text": "Difficult people do exist at work. They come in every variety and no workplace is without them. How difficult a person is for you to deal with depends on your self-esteem, your self-confidence, and your professional courage.Dealing with difficult people is easier when the person is just generally obnoxious or when the behavior affects more than one person. Dealing with them is much tougher when they are attacking you or undermining your professional contribution.Difficult people come in every conceivable variety. Some talk constantly and never listen. Others must always have the last word. Some coworkers fail to keep commitments. Others criticize anything that they did not create. Difficult coworkers compete with you for power, privilege, and the spotlight; some go way too far in courting the boss\u2019s positive opinion \u2013 to your detriment.Some coworkers attempt to undermine you and you constantly feel as if you need to watch your back. Your boss plays favorites and the favored party lords it over you; people form cliques and leave you out. Difficult people and situations exist in every workplace.They all have one thing in common. You must address them. No matter the type of difficult situation in which you find yourself, dealing with difficult people or situations is a must.Why You Must Deal With Difficult PeopleTrust me. Your situation won\u2019t get better; left unaddressed, it usually gets worse. Unaddressed, necessary conflict simmers just below \u2013 and often erupts counter-productively above \u2013 the surface at work.Initially, people go into shock when they are treated unprofessionally, so if you take some time to understand exactly what is happening to you, you are not alone. Once you are fully aware of what is happening, deciding to live with the situation long term is not an option.You become so angry and feel so much pain that your efforts to address the situation become irrational. It\u2019s far better to address the difficult person while you can maintain some objectivity and emotional control.Constant complaining about the coworker or situation can quickly earn you the title of whiner or complainer. Managers wonder why you are unable to solve your own problems \u2013 even if the manager\u2019s tolerance or encouragement of the situation is part of the problem.Worse Case Scenario If You Fail to Deal With Difficult PeopleMost importantly, if you are embroiled in a constant conflict at work, you may not only get blamed for being \u201cunable to handle the situation like a mature professional,\u201d you may be labeled as a \u201cdifficult\u201d person, too. This label is hard to escape and can have devastating consequences for your career.Finally, if the situation continues to deteriorate over time, the organization and your boss may tire of you. The boss may decide you are a \u201chigh maintenance\u201d employee, easily replaced with a more professional or cooperative person, and you could lose your job.Dealing With the Difficult CoworkerI've experienced workplaces in which all sorts of dysfunctional approaches to dealing with a difficult coworker have been tried. Putting an anonymous note in the person\u2019s mailbox is not an option. Placing a can of deodorant on a hygiene-challenged coworker\u2019s desk is not a productive option either. Confronting the \u200bbully publicly can often lead to disaster. Putting dead bugs in his desk drawer can leave your boss no option other than to fire you. So, let\u2019s look at more productive ways to address your difficult coworker.Are you convinced that in almost all cases you need to productively deal with your difficult coworker? Good. Then, read on to find ten ways to approach dealing with difficult people.These are ten productive ways to deal with your difficult coworker. Let's start with the first five. Start out by examining yourself. Are you sure that the other person is really the problem and that you're not overreacting? Have you always experienced difficulty with the same type of person or actions?Does a pattern exist for you in your interaction with coworkers? Do you recognize that you have hot buttons that are easily pushed? (We all do, you know.) Always start with self-examination to determine that the object of your attention really is a difficult person\u2019s actions. Explore what you are experiencing with a trusted friend or colleague. Brainstorm ways to address the situation. When you are the object of an attack, or your boss appears to support the dysfunctional actions of a coworker, it is often difficult to objectively assess your options. Anger, pain, humiliation, fear, and concern about making the situation worse are legitimate emotions.Pay attention to the unspoken agreement you create when you solicit another\u2019s assistance. You are committing to act unless you agree actions will only hurt the situation. Otherwise, you risk becoming a whiner or complainer in the eyes of your colleague. Approach the person with whom you are having the problem for a private discussion. Talk to the coworker about what you are experiencing in \u201cI\u201d messages. (Using \u201cI\u201d messages is a communication approach that focuses on your experience of the situation rather than on attacking or accusing the other person.) You can also explain to your coworker the impact of their actions on you.Be pleasant and agreeable as you talk with the other person. They may not be aware of the impact of their words or actions on you. They may be learning about their impact on you for the first time. Or, they may have to consider and confront a pattern in their own interaction with people. Worst case?They may know their impact on you and deny it or try to explain it away. Unfortunately, some difficult people just don\u2019t care. During the discussion, attempt to reach agreement about positive and supportive actions going forward. Follow-up after the initial discussion. Has the behavior changed? Gotten better? Or worse? Determine whether a follow-up discussion is needed. Determine whether a follow-up discussion will have any impact. Decide if you want to continue to confront the difficult person by yourself.Become a peacemaker. (Decide how badly you want to make peace with the other person and how much you want your current job. Determine whether you have experienced a pattern of support from your boss.) If you answer, \u201cyes,\u201d to these questions, hold another discussion. If not, escalate and move to the next idea. You can confront your difficult coworker\u2019s behavior publicly. Deal with the person with gentle humor or slight sarcasm. Or, make an exaggerated physical gesture \u2013 no, not that one \u2013 such as a salute or place your hand over your heart to indicate a serious wounding.You can also tell the difficult person that you\u2019d like them to consider important history in their decision making or similar words expressed positively, depending on the subject. Direct confrontation does work well for some people in some situations. I don\u2019t think it works to ask the person to stop doing what they\u2019re doing, publicly, but you can employ more positive confrontational tactics.Their success for you will depend on your ability to pull them off. Each of us is not spur-of-the-moment funny, but if you are, you can use the humor well with difficult coworkers.Want five more tips? Fleeing is definitely an option.If you have done what you can do and employed the first five recommended approaches with little or no success, it\u2019s time to involve others - your boss or a manager. Note that you are escalating the situation. Prepare to talk with your boss.Take notes and address the issues, not as interpersonal problems, but as issues affecting your productivity, the work and your progress on projects. Tell your boss exactly what the difficult person does.Make a plan to address the issues. Perhaps involve your coworker's boss. Recognize that a good boss is likely to bring your difficult coworker and his supervisor into a three or four-way discussion at this point. Expect to participate in follow-up over time. Rally the other employees who might have an issue with the difficult person, too - carefully. Sometimes, a group approach convinces the boss that the impact of the behavior is wider and deeper than she had originally determined. Be careful with this approach, however. Know what works with your boss. You want to solve your problem, not make it look as if you are rabble-rousing and ganging up on another employee. If these approaches fail to work, try to limit the difficult person's access to you. Protect the needs of your business, but avoid working with the person when possible. Leave voluntary committees, Choose projects he or she does not impact. Don\u2019t hurt your own career or your business, but avoidance is an option. Transfer to a new job within your organization. Depending on the size of your company, you may never have to work with this difficult coworker again. Fleeing is definitely an option. If all else fails, you can quit your job. What, flee, you ask? But, I wasn't the employee with the problem. I was not the difficult coworker. All I tried to do was my job. You're right. But, what price, in terms of your happiness and success, are you willing to pay to stay? You need to decide whether the good in your current situation outweighs the bad or whether the bad outweighs the good.If the good wins, stop complaining and get back to work. Backtrack on these recommended steps and retry some of them when appropriate. If the bad wins, redirect your energy to leaving your current employment. You'll be glad you did.

{"title": "The Most Underrated Factor in Retirement Planning", "text": "As a practical matter, the factors that determine how long our savings will last after we retire fall into two categories: those we can control and those we cannot. Major factors that are largely beyond our control include, of course, capital markets returns and how long we live. Factors that are, at least to some degree, within our control include:\nAnnual withdrawal amount\nAnnual withdrawal adjustment (cost of living increase)\nAsset allocation (how money is invested)\nInvestment expenses\nWithdrawal strategy (which assets to withdraw, and when)\nWhile each of these has been has been explored in academic research, a review of popular financial planning applications finds that the influence of withdrawal strategy has been largely ignored at the consumer/advisor level. In fact, nearly all programs assume that retiree portfolios maintain a constant allocation with annual portfolio rebalancing throughout retirement. Under these models, withdrawals from the various asset classes are typically made in proportion to their weight in the portfolio, followed by rebalancing to get the asset classes back to their designated percentages of the portfolio. The unanimity with which this methodology has been applied has led to the implicit assumption that constant allocation with annual rebalancing is an efficient withdrawal strategy for real world portfolios. But is this truly the case?\nTo illustrate the influence that withdrawal strategy may have on retirement income sustainability, consider the following reasonably realistic retirement planning scenario:\n30-year retirement horizon\n$1 million initial retirement portfolio value\n5% ($50,000) initial withdrawal rate\n3% annual cost of living increase\n60%-to-40% allocation between stocks and bonds, with equities divided 50% large cap, 30% small and mid-cap and 20% international; bonds are assumed to generate a constant 2% rate of return (roughly equivalent to the current 10-year Treasury yield)\n1% annual investment expenses\nWith these conditions, I tested four different withdrawal strategies using Nest Egg Guru\u2019s Retirement Spending Calculator, a tool I developed. The results of 5,000 simulations for each of the four strategies tested are presented in the tables below. The left column shows performance percentiles for the portfolios in the 5,000 simulations \u2014 the performance for the portfolio at the 80th percentile, the 60th percentile and so on, down to the worst performing portfolio in any simulation. The amounts in the grid are the remaining portfolio balances in five-year increments at the given percentile. Each table also shows the median portfolio \u2014 where half did better and half did worse \u2014 as well as the percentage of the 5,000 simulations that were successful, meaning they did not run out of money in the 30-year time horizon.\nTable 1: Constant allocation with annual rebalancing\nAfter 5 years After 10 years After 15 years After 20 years After 25 years After 30 years 80% $1,137,729 $1,172,459 $1,146,773 $1,031,320 $800,109 $398,250 60% $1,040,119 $1,013,125 $911,622 $706,797 $363,854 $0 Median $1,000,056 $948,556 $821,387 $586,174 $204,780 $0 40% $963,387 $887,022 $738,255 $470,920 $52,022 $0 20% $878,966 $757,068 $557,295 $236,818 $0 $0 10% $821,860 $667,768 $443,363 $89,182 $0 $0 5% $775,159 $605,068 $352,952 $0 $0 $0 1% $699,417 $492,482 $197,532 $0 $0 $0 Worst $503,642 $326,809 $0 $0 $0 $0 Successful portfolios out of 5,000 simulations: 33%\nTable 2: Spend stocks first, then bonds\n(aka \u201cdecreasing equity glide path\u201d)\nAfter 5 years After 10 years After 15 years After 20 years After 25 years After 30 years 80% $1,162,892 $1,238,895 $1,260,444 $1,183,393 $950,538 $476,841 60% $1,061,060 $1,041,591 $927,376 $648,659 $191,150 $0 Median $1,016,758 $969,991 $809,147 $479,639 $10,356 $0 40% $977,282 $907,377 $700,820 $328,379 $0 $0 20% $894,416 $758,956 $479,866 $78,425 $0 $0 10% $838,197 $664,005 $350,914 $0 $0 $0 5% $792,110 $596,853 $267,233 $0 $0 $0 1% $726,039 $483,857 $141,131 $0 $0 $0 Worst $597,805 $328,664 $0 $0 $0 $0 Successful portfolios out of 5,000 simulations: 28%\nTable 3: Spend bonds first, then stocks\n(aka \u201cincreasing equity glide path\u201d)\nAfter 5 years After 10 years After 15 years After 20 years After 25 years After 30 years 80% $1,263,887 $1,669,648 $2,213,821 $2,958,149 $4,075,010 $5,617,357 60% $1,139,420 $1,379,905 $1,679,625 $2,047,998 $2,506,349 $3,115,210 Median $1,086,910 $1,252,170 $1,472,501 $1,726,569 $1,982,359 $2,291,928 40% $1,039,641 $1,148,977 $1,294,884 $1,426,769 $1,560,436 $1,661,194 20% $930,511 $938,749 $930,711 $860,302 $684,657 $334,555 10% $860,841 $803,159 $715,574 $532,279 $189,950 $0 5% $803,733 $692,743 $540,962 $276,619 $0 $0 1% $721,644 $546,435 $329,655 $0 $0 $0 Worst $565,375 $389,871 $109,667 $0 $0 $0 Successful portfolios out of 5,000 simulations: 84%\nTable 3: Guardrail strategy\n(constant allocation, but don\u2019t spend stocks in down years)\nAfter 5 years After 10 years After 15 years After 20 years After 25 years After 30 years 80% $1,189,575 $1,305,962 $1,387,572 $1,410,688 $1,363,863 $1,196,561 60% $1,090,035 $1,132,793 $1,121,753 $1,041,343 $850,021 $504,264 Median $1,045,967 $1,059,162 $1,012,507 $903,398 $665,818 $254,090 40% $1,007,300 $990,642 $912,330 $756,833 $467,758 $0 20% $917,183 $843,439 $703,256 $464,644 $75,971 $0 10% $851,920 $747,003 $574,123 $291,512 $0 $0 5% $798,659 $672,845 $473,558 $156,785 $0 $0 1% $717,655 $541,782 $309,967 $0 $0 $0 Worst $560,925 $278,232 $0 $0 $0 $0 Successful portfolios out of 5,000 simulations: 60%\nNote: The guardrail strategy involves converting stock and bond gains, if any, to cash and then spending down the cash, followed by bonds and then stocks. Under this approach, equity allocations are not reduced following negative-return years until all of the cash and bond allocations have been exhausted.\nThe results in these four tables clearly show that the choice of withdrawal strategy can have a dramatic effect on retirement income sustainability. The results also show how the widely adopted constant allocation strategy may be less than optimal.\nThough the difference between the constant allocation and \u201cbonds-first\u201d withdrawal strategy is surprisingly dramatic, it is generally consistent with published research. For example, in a June 2007 paper in the Journal of Financial Planning, SUNY professors John Spitzer and Sandeep Singh demonstrated the superiority of a similar bonds-first withdrawal strategy. They concluded:\n\u201cWhile the wisdom of rebalancing in the accumulation phase of the life cycle is widely accepted, the wisdom does not appear to extend to the withdrawal phase. \u2026 Rebalancing during the withdrawal phase provides no significant protection on portfolio longevity.\u201d\nMore recently, in a 2014 article in the Journal of Financial Planning, noted retirement researchers Wade Pfau of American University and Michael Kitces of the blog Nerd\u2019s Eye View (not affiliated with NerdWallet) reached a similar conclusion about the value of avoiding equity withdrawals early in retirement.\nWhile this post is intended to draw attention to the fact that withdrawal strategy is an overlooked and critically important consideration in determining income and portfolio sustainability, it is not necessarily intended to suggest that the bonds-first approach is the optimal solution. Indeed, a number of papers have been published recently proposing a range of dynamic withdrawal strategies that are likely superior the ones presented in this paper. Whether these strategies are practically implementable by consumers and their financial planners is a matter for further discussion. Critical thinking is required by the user in evaluating the merits and limitations of all retirement planning calculators.\nThis article also appears at Nasdaq.\nImage via iStock."}

{"title": "Dispelling the Top 5 Myths Surrounding Life Insurance Benefits", "text": "For quite a few people, paying for life insurance on a monthly basis just does not make sense when they could use the money to pay for bills or other items upfront. According to a 2015 study from LIMRA, 61 percent of consumers said that paying their mortgage, grocery bill or monthly rent was their top financial priority. We will discuss five common myths about life insurance and debunk them here.Myth #1 - Life Insurance Policies Are the Same Across the BoardThe first myth about life insurance that has become quite common is that all of the policies are the same. This cannot be further from the truth. There are several types of life insurance policies available today; but the most common offered are whole life and term life. Whole life is just that; the policy lasts your entire life and expires when you die. Term life lasts for a set term, or amount of time, typically 30 years or so. Some people choose term life, while others prefer whole life. Then, there are some people who have a combination of both policies to protect themselves and their loved ones.Myth #2 - Group Life Insurance Offered by an Employer is EnoughThe second myth we will debunk today is that life insurance solely from an employer is enough. This is a myth because it all depends on each individual\u2019s situation. Some people are comfortable with the life insurance provided by an employer. Others feel they need a little more protection for themselves and their loved ones so they purchase an additional supplemental policy or two on their own. Those who only have life insurance through their employer tend to go this route because it is paid for by the employer and there are no out-of-pocket expenses for the employee.Myth #3 - Qualifying for Life Insurance is DifficultMany people believe that qualifying for life insurance is difficult, especially those who have to purchase it on their own. There are some policies out there that require lab tests, blood work and a physical prior to the policy being activated. But, not every life insurance policy requires this amount of work prior to activation. You can obtain a life insurance policy online or through the mail without jumping through all of these hoops. You will simply need to provide a tiny bit of health information prior to activation.Myth #4 - Ignore the Policy Once It\u2019s PurchasedAnother common myth about life insurance is that it is alright to ignore the policy once it has been purchased. If you follow this myth, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage. You will want to review your life insurance policy at least every couple of years to make sure it is enough coverage based on your financial situation. You should also revisit the policy if a major life change has occurred. Major life changes include unemployment, divorce, death of a spouse or birth of a child.Myth #5 - Life Insurance is Just too ExpensivePossibly one of the most common myths about life insurance, and biggest excuses given by those who do not have coverage, is that life insurance is expensive. There are different levels of premiums available for policies, but the bottom line is that the younger you are when you secure the policy, the more affordable the premium will be throughout the life of the coverage. Now, term life insurance is a more affordable option, but the premiums will increase at various intervals throughout the life of the policy. You will pay more for whole life insurance, but the premiums will not change during the life of the policy.As you can see, the five myths about life insurance debunked above are quite common. In fact, they actually make sense before reading all the facts. But, they are definitely myths.Image Credit: Depositphotos.com"}

{"title": "The General Warranty Deed Explained", "text": "A common question is about the nature of a general warranty deed and what rights it conveys to the buyer.  A real estate buyer is best protected by a General Warranty Deed. The seller or grantor conveys the property with certain covenants or warranties. The grantor is legally bound by these warranties. Whether expressly written into the deed, or implied by certain statutory words, basic warranties include:Covenant of seisin-Seisin means possession, and the grantor warrants that they own the property and have the legal right to convey it.Covenant against encumbrances-The Grantor warrants that the property is free of any liens or encumbrances unless they're specifically stated in the deed.Covenant of quiet enjoyment-The buyer is guaranteed that the title will be good against third parties attempting to establish title to the property.Covenant of further assurance- The Grantor promises, in order to make the title good, they will deliver any document or instrument necessary.The covenants or warranties in a general warranty deed do not cover just the period of ownership of this grantor. They extend back to the origin of the property. Each grantor of a general warranty deed in the title chain would be liable for title problems before and through their ownership.Property Ownership Restrictions and CovenantsOver time, and with development and population growth, there has been a great deal of legal and societal attention paid to property ownership and the rights of others around your property, as well as your rights.  Subdivisions and homeowner associations are created to create rules and manage the relationships of the homeowners.HOA, Homeowner Association, documents for a subdivision can be quite a pile of paper.  The covenants and restrictions range from fairly liberal to extremely limiting in how a property owner can use and enjoy their property.  Homeowners buying in a subdivision should pay careful attention to the restrictions and covenants, as they could be planning on something that's against the rules.  Look for:limits on the number of vehicles that can be parked on the property.limiting the places on the property vehicles can be parked.restricting the type of vehicles, trailers, boats, etc that can be visible on the property instead of housed in a garage.restrictions on renting out the home, either a total restriction or more likely requiring a long term lease.fence height restrictions, or rules against fences.fence construction restrictions, such as no chain link, etc.limits on outbuildings, number, size, height, location.requirements for lawn and landscape maintenance, mowing, limits on grass height, etc.rules for exterior modifications, restrictions on colors, styling, etc.restrictions on adding swimming pool, outdoor hot tub, etc.rules for noise and annoyances to neighbors.limits or restrictions on types and number of animals, as well as size.There are lots more, but you're getting the idea.  I once owned a home in a subdivision in the Houston, TX area and kept my boat in the garage because that was one of the HOA rules.  I wanted to sell the boat and called Boat Trader.  They said I could leave a check in the boat glove box and park it outside so they could photograph it.  I did that and came home to find a letter on my door about breaking the rules.  Sometimes people have nothing more to do than drive around and look for violations to these restrictions.In more rural areas, there may not be a subdivision or homeowner association, but there can be restrictions in the deed that conveys the property.  If so, they will be continued in every deed into the future, so they're important.  In one case in rural New Mexico, I sold a home on 30 acres.  Owners two transfers back had placed a restriction in the deed on the number of trees that could be cut in building or doing any other improvements on the property.  The people who originally placed that restriction in the deed were long since deceased, and there really was nobody around with any great interest in enforcement, but it stayed in each deed moving forward.  These are just things to check in property documents."}
{"title": "LGBT Community Can Ease Retirement Worries With Planning, Guidance", "text": "It\u2019s common to worry whether you will have enough for retirement and be financially secure as you get older. But Services & Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Elders released a study in October 2014 finding that the LGBT community is far more concerned about these issues.\nSAGE, a nonprofit group focusing on improving the lives of older LGBT people, found that 51% of LGBT elders are worried they won\u2019t have enough money as they age, compared to 36% of the general population. Additionally, over 40% of older LGBT people fear they\u2019ll outlive retirement savings and are very concerned they\u2019ll have to work beyond retirement age, with only a quarter of non-LGBT people sharing the same level of concern.\nLGBT seniors and financial security\nThis elevated level of financial insecurity in the LGBT community, in addition to higher poverty rates among aging LGBT elders, can be attributed to several factors, according to Robert Espinoza, senior director of public policy and communications at SAGE.\nEspinoza explains that today\u2019s LGBT elders lived through decades of overt institutional discrimination, leading many of them not to trust financial institutions. SAGE research has found they\u2019re more likely to do retirement planning on their own. Additionally, workplace and employment discrimination has resulted in less career advancement for many, leaving them with less in retirement savings.\nIn addition, marriage equality laws are currently a patchwork, Espinoza says, leaving significant confusion about federal benefits.\n\u201cEven though same sex marriage is slowly moving across the U.S., the rights in states that do not recognize same sex marriage are a concern for retirement,\u201d says Kimberly J. Howard, a certified financial planner and owner of KJH Financial Services in Newton, Massachusetts, and Denver, who helps LGBT individuals and families. \u201cFor example, Social Security, state pension, company pensions and military benefits do not always recognize same-sex partners for spousal benefits. The lack of spousal benefits could determine whether the retirement phase is a comfortable or a stressful time.\u201d\nEnita Torres, a 56-year-old Houston resident, says she\u2019s anxious about whether she and her partner of nearly 30 years will be able to receive each others\u2019 Social Security benefits.\n\u201cThe way the laws are now, if I pass away, I\u2019m not clear if my partner could get my Social Security benefits,\u201d Torres says. \u201cThe federal changes aren\u2019t clear, so I\u2019m just not sure.\u201d She says she and her partner also worry about not getting property-tax exemptions and retirement health care benefits that her parents enjoyed.\nEspinoza also says ageism can be a problem.\n\u201cIn the LGBT community, we find there\u2019s an obsession with youth, and people don\u2019t want to talk about aging,\u201d Espinoza says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not talking about aging, you\u2019re probably not talking about the type of life you want to live in your older years.\u201d\nLGBT-friendly financial, legal professionals\nDetermined not to be another statistic? An LGBT-friendly financial planner is your greatest ally. Howard says many LGBT people are reluctant to seek out advisors, but it\u2019s important due to the unique financial issues facing the community. \u201cThese issues include spousal retirement benefits, state and company pensions, how to handle beneficiary concerns and long-term care policies,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, as hard as it is, the individual needs to be forthcoming about being LGBT, or advice may not be very helpful.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to go, some financial institutions now have planners dedicated to the LGBT community. A pioneer in this field, Wells Fargo created the Accredited Domestic Partnership Advisor program, which has over 500 advisors across the country qualified to help same-sex spouses and domestic partners plan their finances.\nMargie Archer, a vice president and advisor in Wells Fargo\u2019s program, says it\u2019s important to find an advisor you can be authentic with and start planning now. In addition to helping you answer common questions such as how much you need for retirement and when you can retire, Archer says LGBT-friendly advisors are invaluable for same-sex couples. They can help you with concerns such as whether your partner will get your Social Security or retirement benefits, how to ensure your partner inherits your assets, whether it is financially smart for you marry and whether you should make a financial plan together or separately.\nThere are other steps you can take now to feel more prepared for your future. Follow these expert tips for increased financial security:\nCreate an advance directive\nAn advance directive is an important part of financial planning, Espinoza says, because your end-of-life and medical decisions may affect your financial decisions. An advance directive contains both a living will, which explains your health care wishes, and a medical power of attorney, which allows you to designate a health care proxy. Your health care proxy is the person you choose to make your medical decisions if you become incapacitated physically or cognitively. This person also would manage the financial aspects of your health care, he explains. You can create these legal forms separately, but creating them together ensures they\u2019re in sync.\nEspinoza adds that although most older LGBT people are single and don\u2019t have biological children, the law privileges your biological next of kin as your health care proxy. \u201cIf you want to protect and support your family of choice, make sure you have planned to do that and it doesn\u2019t default to blood relatives,\u201d he says. Archer also recommends bringing these documents with you when you travel outside of your state or country in case anything happens to you, especially if you are married but traveling somewhere that doesn\u2019t recognize it.\nConsider long-term care insurance\nArcher says aging same-sex couples, especially those without children, often worry whether they can live at an elder care facility together. She says having long-term care insurance is vital to ensuring you will be taken care of and have a choice in where you go.\nDon\u2019t forget estate planning\nYou should also consider what happens to your money after your death. Espinoza says disputes about how the deceased\u2019s money and estate should be handled are common among family members. \u201cIf you really want to make sure your friends and family understand and respect your wishes, you have those conversations as early as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cThey should not find out after you die how you want your money spent.\u201d\nHire an LGBT-friendly lawyer\nAn LGBT-friendly lawyer can create the documents mentioned above, and if you\u2019re in a same-sex partnership, help you interpret the laws and determine which benefits you\u2019re eligible for in your state. It\u2019s important to understand what if any survivor benefits, tax benefits or Social Security you will receive so you can plan your finances accordingly.\nTorres and her partner have been working with LGBT lawyers for 20 years to ensure they have wills and other documents needed to protect each other. \u201cWe have to put a lot more in writing to try to keep our relationship and inheritance safe,\u201d Torres says. She still worries that their documents could be challenged if they get a judge who doesn\u2019t recognize their relationship, but they feel as prepared as they can be with their documents in place and joint tenancy on their financial accounts.\nResources for the aging LGBT community\nIf you need help finding LGBT-friendly resources where you live, visit the local resources section on SAGE\u2019s National Resource Center on LGBT Aging. They list services by state that can help with everything from finding an LGBT-friendly retirement facility to getting a free advance directive. Lamba Legal also can help you determine your rights in each state.\nImage via iStock."}

{"title": "How to Select a Construction Marketing Agency", "text": "One of the most important decisions you can make for your construction business is selecting a marketing agency that is capable of managing and implementing your projects competently and efficiently. You need to work with an agency that is capable of helping you be successful and can demonstrate measurable results.It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult, considering that is why these businesses exist, but it can be. There are some great agencies out there, but some aren't so great. How can you tell the difference before you find yourself in a contract situation with an agency that isn't a good fit for your business?Entering into a contract with the wrong agency partner can not only end badly, but also be a costly and embarrassing mistake. Let's have a look at some of the things that make a marketing agency weak and then some of the things that make it a good ally for your construction business.Signs of a Poor Marketing AgencyMany sub-par marketing agencies put up some obvious red flags. Here are a few things to observe, and if you see any of them, move along:They cannot demonstrate good results in sales or marketing (or back up their claims with numbers).They impose excessive fees and constantly dispute terms.They are out of touch with SEO, social networking, blogging, and other forms of popular media.They were hired by a previous manager and can't figure out how to work with the new boss.Signs of a Good Marketing AgencyConversely, there are those signs that aren't red flags, but rather ringing endorsements for an agency. Among them:They are specialists in the construction field.They constantly brainstorm and share new ideas.Their actions prove that they want to be your partner.They can demonstrate positive results.They work well with management no matter who is in charge or how procedures may shift over time.Like with anything else related to your business, due diligence is a major help in preventing disaster when working with a marketing agency. There are several reliable avenues to finding the perfect fit.The first and most important is through referrals and networking. Just searching online will put you in touch with a lot of companies, but you need to pay attention to their reviews. If it's in your budget, you can even hire an agency search firm to do the grunt work for you. The selection process works best when you approach it in three stages.Stage One: Establish the Terms of Your SelectionAssess a realistic budget for marketing services. Decide if you want an agency that deals strictly with construction or if one with only category expertise in that area is sufficient. Determine what marketing skills are most important. Finally, consider the geography contingency. You want an agency that is close by if you intend to have a number of onsite meetings.Stage Two: Identify Possible MatchesDepending on the scope and scale of your marketing efforts, it is best to narrow the search to between five and 10 agencies and give each a thorough review. Once you have it narrowed down further \u2013 let's say to three or four solid candidates \u2013 it's time to make contact and set up some interviews. At this stage, Skype or phone will work just fine. Follow up your interviews with onsite visits and be sure that the people who show up are the ones who will be working with you.If yours is a larger organization, you might also want to recruit a committee to evaluate the candidates and get some extra feedback.Stage Three: Hire an AgencyAt this point, you (and your selection committee, is applicable) should sit down and decide which agency gets the job. If you select representatives you know to be team players and not dominant or controlling, it should be easy to come to an agreement about who to hire.The above will provide you with a good basic formula around which to build your selection process. Have more questions about how to improve your construction business? There\u2019re plenty of other resources that can help you manage every aspect of your business, including construction management software (many of which even have marketing functionality built-in)."}
{"title": "How to Refinance an Auto Loan in 6 Simple Steps", "text": "Refinancing an auto loan is far easier than refinancing a mortgage. It can save you thousands of dollars in interest and you may be able to pay off your car faster. It is important to know what is involved in the refinance process and whether this is a good option for you.Is It Time to Refinance Your Auto Loan?Every situation is different and the first step to determine if refinancing is right for you is to take a quick look at the current market and your financial  position.Consider refinancing your auto loan if: Interest rates have dropped since you bought your car.Your credit score has improved. This could mean that you qualify for a better rate.You financed your car through a dealership. The rates are often higher through dealer financing, so it's good to look at other sources when you can.Information You Will Need Before RefinancingUnlike a mortgage, auto refinancing should require just a couple of documents. Gather this information before you begin so you have all the facts when asked for it.A copy of your current loan papers.Information about your vehicle like the VIN and current mileage.6 Steps to Refinancing Your Auto LoanReview the terms of your existing auto loan. Before you start shopping for a new loan, you need to know where you stand with your current loan.What are you paying in interest?How many months do you have left on the loan?What is your current payoff amount? This is the amount you would pay the lender if you paid the entire bill today.Is there a pre-payment penalty in place? Some lenders only allow borrowers to pay off a certain amount of their loan each year without a penalty. It is more common with a home mortgage, though may apply to some car loans.Determine if your car qualifies. While each bank has its own qualification requirements, most banks will not refinance a vehicle if it or the loan meet certain conditions.Your current loan has less than $7,500 remaining.Your car is over seven years old.Your car has 100,000 miles or more (some banks set the cap at 70,000).You use the car commercially.Your car has a salvage title.You also won't have much luck refinancing a motorcycle or RV. Some banks even rule out certain vehicle makes.Compare rates. Call a few banks in your area to get a feel for what the current interest rates are. You can also use a site like bankrate.com to look up the national averages.Tip: Be sure to go by used car interest rates. When you refinance, that's the rate you're likely to pay, even if you have a new car loan now.Estimate how much a refinance will save you. You can use an online auto loan calculator to get the job done.Apply for an auto refinance loan. If refinancing still seems to make sense after running your calculations, it's time to dig into all of the details.Question the banks that you're considering about any fees that you'll be expected to pay. A small fee to transfer the title and re-register the vehicle is to be expected, but some banks may also tack on a processing fee.Ask if there is a pre-payment penalty built into the loan. You want to avoid this because it will penalize you for paying off your loan early.Once you've compared all of your options, submit your loan application to the bank with the best deal.Review your paperwork and finalize your loan. Then, walk around feeling smart because you saved a bunch of money!Final Tips for Auto Loan RefinancingMost banks will only refinance auto loans from other banks. Don't be surprised if your current bank turns you down.Avoid cash out refinance offers (refinancing for more than the amount owed so you get the difference in cash). That may be an option with a home mortgage, but not the best for a car. These add to the length and cost of your loan and a car loses value quickly, so it's not likely to save money."}
{"title": "Tearing Down a House and Alternatives", "text": "Tearing down a house might be easier and cheaper than trying to fix-up a home that has completely deteriorated. It's also less expensive than, say, moving a home to another lot. But sometimes the home in such poor condition that it can't be salvaged.I asked an agent in my office -- who deals with a lot of contractors in Midtown Sacramento -- how much it would cost to tear down a house. The agent estimated a ballpark figure of $15,000 to $20,000.To confirm that estimate, I called an independent contractor, Jeff Von Rotz Construction. Mr. Von Rotz recently demolished a 1500 square foot, single-story house in Midtown -- demoing it back to the dirt, which means removing the foundation -- for about $18,000. That price also included tearing out the basement.Bear in mind, these are 2007 prices, which will likely increase over time due to inflation and may cost more in other cities. But it's still, excuse the expression, dirt cheap to tear down a house and haul it away. Having torn down structures myself, I have first-hand experience that bids can be all over the place. Just to tear down a small carriage house in 1995, I received bids ranging from $150 to $1200. Make sure the bids include hauling away and disposal.Is the House Worth Tearing Down?Before hiring a bulldozer to slam into your house and smash it into smithereens, consider hiring a consultant who can advise you if it makes financial sense to tear down the house. A house that may look like a total ruin to you might be salvageable. Fixing crumbling walls, sagging roofs or sloping foundations is not as expensive as you may imagine.On the other hand, considering that postage-stamped lots sell in metropolitan cities like Sacramento for more than $300,000, the land on which the home is situated might be worth more without a house if that house has outlived its useful life.Check with your city building department to find out if the home you want to tear down is on a historical preservation list. In Midtown Sacramento, for example, Victorians cannot be destroyed, even if their foundations and wood components are decayed.Before You Tear Down a House Obtain a Permit.You will most likely need a permit to tear down the house, so check with city and county officials. Sometimes home owners do work without a permit, which is never advised, thinking nobody will notice. But a huge bulldozer in the yard, clawing away gigantic chunks of your house and slamming the debris into rubble, is going to draw attention. So, get a permit, if it is required. Check with the Fire Department and Utility Companies.You may not realize that gas, water, and electricity can't simply be turned off and ripped out. Utilities need to be properly disconnected and abandoned or terminated at the source. Your local fire department and utility companies might want to inspect and sign-off on this work first. Inspect for Hazardous Materials.Many older homes were constructed with materials that today are considered hazardous. Asbestos, for example, was commonly used in flooring, ceilings, wrapped around duct work and contained in siding. Asbestos abatement can cost an additional $2 to $3 per square foot to remove, according to Von Rotz Construction. If you discover an old diesel tank underground, except to pay a surcharge. Call Your Mortgage Lender.Unless your property is free and clear from any liens or encumbrances, your mortgage is secured to the structure as well as the land. Your lender has an interest in the building itself, so you cannot unilaterally destroy the lender's security without permission.If the lender's security is damaged, realize your loan may contain an acceleration clause, which allows the lender to immediately demand payment in full. An alternative is to arrange for construction financing, which will carry a higher interest. Submit Building Plans for ApprovalEven if city building codes allow construction of certain structures, your community may prevent you from building the home you desire. If you don't want to find yourself sitting in the dirt on a vacant lot, drying tears with your architectural drawings, submit your plans to all the appropriate authorities beforehand.Moving the House Instead of Tearing it DownAlthough it can cost around $100,000 or more to move a house, transporting it to another location is a reasonable solution you might want to consider. One way that kind of situation can work is like this: You offer to sell the house to a buyer for $1.00, providing the buyer bears the expense of moving it. You win. The buyers win.But make sure the house can physically be moved to its new location before signing the deed. For example, areas such as downtown and Midtown Sacramento are bordered by freeways. These neighborhoods are essentially landlocked because the homes are too tall to fit under a bridge or freeway. Thinking ahead is priceless.At the time of writing, Elizabeth Weintraub, CalBRE #00697006, is a Broker-Associate at Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, California."}
{"title": "How to Set Up a Special Needs Trust Savings Account", "text": "When setting up a special needs trust, one important consideration is that it must be set up so that the beneficiary of the trust will not lose her existing government benefits, such as SSI and Medicaid. If done wrong, the entire contents of the trust will end up being paid out for medical bills or other costs until the trust is depleted. If set up properly, the trust will be there to ensure your loved one is able to maintain a decent standard of living when you are no longer there.Decide if you want the trust to be revocable or irrevocable. A revocable trust might be helpful if you think you might need to take the assets back out of it at any point, but it is also subject to claims by creditors as well as estate taxes when you die. An irrevocable trust means that you cannot change your mind and access any of the funds or alter any of the terms, but it also means the funds in it are not subject to probate, estate taxes or claims by creditors.Establish a trust account for the special needs beneficiary. The complications involved in a special needs trust make it advisable to seek the assistance of an experienced attorney. A mistake could cost the beneficiary all of her government benefits and the cash in her trust fund as well. Check with the Bar Association in your state for a referral service that can help you find the type of lawyer that you need.Determine the terms to be included in the trust. Consider that the trust must be established by someone other than the person with special needs, it must be managed by a trustee that can use his discretion when providing funds to the beneficiary, and it should make clear that the trust cannot pay out more in benefits than the government allows.Sign the final version of the trust documents. Trust documents are legal forms and must be signed and notarized in front of witnesses.Locate a trustee to manage the account and a custodian to hold the assets. You can be the trustee, but your trust documents should also assign a successor such as a sibling or another trusted relative. The custodian is typically a bank that holds the funds in the savings account.Create a savings account at a bank, credit union or other financial institution. This account must be placed into the trust so it will not belong to an individual but instead will belong to the trust itself. In most cases you can add to this savings account at any time, but once you put money in it you no longer have access to those funds. Build the account so that there will be enough money in the trust to care for your loved one after you die. Tips  Consider adding a life insurance policy to the trust, to provide an additional source of funding for the beneficiary in the future. Making it part of an irrevocable trust will offer tax benefits to your beneficiary.   Warnings  When setting up a special needs trust savings account, you should consult with an attorney to make sure it complies with the law in every detail. If you don\u2019t, you run the risk of the trust not being recognized and the beneficiary would then lose her benefits.  "}
{"title": "How Inflation Affects the Bond Market", "text": "Inflation, or rising price levels for goods and services, can have two negative impacts for bond investors. One is obvious, while the other is more subtle \u2013 and therefore much more insidious.The Impact of Inflation on Federal Reserve PolicyThe first effect is that rising inflation can cause the U.S. Federal Reserve \u2013 or any country\u2019s central bank for that matter \u2013 to raise short-term interest rates in order to reduce the demand for credit and help prevent the economy from overheating. When the Fed raises short-term rates \u2013 or when it is expected to do so in the future \u2013 intermediate and longer-term rates also tend to go up. Since bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, rising yields mean falling prices \u2013 and a lower principal value for your fixed-income investment.The Difference Between Nominal Returns and Real ReturnsThe second impact of inflation is less obvious, but it can take a major bite out of your portfolio returns over time. This important effect is the difference between the \u201cnominal\u201d return \u2013 the return a bond or bond fund provides on paper \u2013 and the \u201creal,\u201d or inflation-adjusted, return.To understand this concept, consider a shopping cart of food that a person buys at the supermarket. If the items in the cart cost $100 this year, inflation of 3% means that the same group of items cost $103 a year later. That same person has a short-term bond fund with a yield of 1%. Over the course of the year, the value of a $100 investment rises to only $101 before taxes. On paper, the investor made 1%. But in real world money, he or she actually lost $2 worth of purchasing power. The \u201creal\u201d return was, therefore, -2%.The average rate of inflation in the United States since 1913 has been 3.2%. While this is skewed somewhat by the high-inflation periods of World War I, World War II, and the 1970s, it still means that investors needed to earn an average annual return of 3.2% just to stay even with inflation.Keep in mind that inflation compounds annually just like investment returns, except with inflation the result is negative. From 1982 through the present, inflation has risen nearly 100% on a cumulative basis due to this compounding effect. Consequently, an investor would have needed to see the value of their investments double during that time just to keep up with inflation.Real Returns vs. SafetyIn some cases, investors are willing to trade a negative real return in exchange for safety. For instance, in August 2013, the average return for a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) was 0.70%. This represents a return below inflation, but in some cases, the preservation of principal is an investor\u2019s most important concern.If safety isn\u2019t your top priority, be mindful of the impact of inflation. If your goal is to build a nest egg for the future, a bond or bond fund \u200bthat pays 2% isn\u2019t going to cut it. Instead, consider a diversified approach incorporating medium- to higher-risk investments such as investment-grade corporate bonds, high-yield bonds, and equities. In addition, many mutual fund companies currently offer \u201creal return\u201d funds specifically designed to stay ahead of inflation over time. One potential drawback to these specialized bond funds is that their management costs tend to be high. Both Vanguard and Fidelity offer products with lower management fees than the industry average.The Bottom LineInflation will always be a silent thief eating away at the value of your investments, but with some awareness and good planning, you will be able to maintain the purchasing power of your savings."}
{"title": "What are the Chances Your Business Will Make It?", "text": "Every day new businesses open while others close. Like any new endeavor, there are plenty of risks involved when starting a business from the ground up. There's always that chance that a new small business won't work out, but don't get discouraged! Examine the numbers before you rule out your business' chances of survival.\n\ncredit: Twenty20\n\nAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there are approximately 28.8 million small businesses in the United States. These small businesses make up 99.7% of all businesses in the United States. That number is huge! Sounds pretty promising right? Let's take a look at some of the statistics.\n\nThere's a greater chance of failure early on\n\nWithin the first two years of business, approximately two-thirds of small businesses make the cut. Over a time span of five years, about half of small businesses are still alive and kicking. Take it up to 10 years and you have approximately one-third of these businesses surviving. These numbers can tell you one thing: During those first few years, a small business runs a greater chance of failing. If you can make it past those hard years, you have a better chance of staying for the long haul.\n\nAll Business Loans has broken it down in this beautiful infographic:\n\n2 things that will help your business succeed\n\nWhy are these businesses failing? Many businesses end up crumbling because of cash flow issues. It takes a lot to run a business and if the money isn't coming in to cover those expenses, then you will have a problem. You also need to stay on top of budgeting and making sure that your statements are lining up like they should. If this isn't quite your thing, then you should be investing in a professional accountant and/or bookkeeper. This is a business expense that you can't afford to cut out, especially if you don't know what the heck you're doing when it comes to managing the business' finances!\n\nIn order to narrow down the chances of your business failing, you can make sure that you're well prepared ahead of time. It's imperative that you do market research to see if there's even a need for what you are trying to offer. Additionally, it's important to determine the potential risks involved in starting the type of business that you want. Different business types come with different risks. You have to have a plan for when those risks arise so your business won't have to suffer the consequences."}
{"title": "Can an Employer Withdraw a Job Offer if I Counter Offer?", "text": "So you've landed a job \u2014 great! But, what happens when the salary isn't quite what you expected? This can be tricky territory, as no one wants to start off a new job with any negativity. Beyond that, many job applicants are concerned that they might jeopardize an offer if they issue a counter offer to an employer, in which they ask for better compensation.Employment at WillUnfortunately, in all states except Montana, individuals are \"employed at-will\" by legal statute so employers can discharge workers without cause. That means an employer can legally withdraw your job offer if he or she feels put off by your request.Exceptions to Employment at WillSeveral other states provide greater latitude in their public policy regarding exceptions to employment-at-will. In most states, the employment-at-will principle extends to cases where job offers are withdrawn under the assumption that the employer could fire an employee at any point in time after the hire anyway.In some states, candidates may be protected by a legal statute called \"promissory estoppel,\" a statute which can be used to defend a job seeker when he or she is negatively impacted as a result of a withdrawn offer. For example, a candidate may have lost his or her original job after giving notice to their prior employer, or he or she may have incurred moving expenses to relocate for the new job.There are other exceptions that can protect applicants when a job offer has been rescinded. Employers can not withdraw an offer for discriminatory reasons, such as race, religion, age or gender. In addition, if a contract for services has been signed, it will supersede employment-at-will and protect the candidate.  How to Successfully Counter OfferAlthough the situation varies on a case-by-case basis, your best bet is to avoid a negative response from the employer in the first place. After all, the manner in which you make a counter offer can impact the chances that an employer will react adversely and withdraw the original offer.Before asking for higher pay or better benefits, be sure to thank your prospective employer for the offer and express your excitement about the position. Go about the conversation with a smile, and be polite and professional at all times.In addition, you should be prepared to defend your request with reasons as to why you deserve increased compensation. Even if you're insulted by a low offer, don't show it. Instead, calmly and kindly explain why you are making a counter offer. Be careful not to represent your counter offer as an ultimatum unless you are prepared to leave the bargaining table without that job.If Your Job Offer Is WithdrawnIf you do end up finding yourself in a sticky situation following a counter offer, remember that you can consult an attorney in your state to determine if you are legally entitled to any protections following the withdrawal of a job offer.Here's more information on what to do if your job offer is withdrawn.Read More: How Can I Negotiate a Counter Offer? | Salary Negotiation Tips | Counter Offer Letters | Job Offer Letters | What to Consider Before Accepting a Job Offer"}

Here's why they're at record lows today. + expand all\n2008 financial crisis (Collapse/bailout phase): September/October 2008 What the Fed did On Sept. 8, 2008, the U.S. Treasury seized control of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and pledged a $200 billion cash injection to help the companies cope with mortgage default losses.\nAbout a week later the government bailed out American International Group Inc., or AIG, with $85 billion.\nThe Fed refused to save Lehman Brothers and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy. Some of the largest financial institutions were on the verge of collapse as the mortgage market melted down. As the crisis hit the global market, the credit freeze spread.\nThe Treasury and the Federal Reserve began working on a $700 billion bailout plan.\nPresident George W. Bush signed the bailout plan into law Oct. 3.\nWeeks later, on Oct. 29, the Fed cut the key interest rate to 1%. What was expected The government claimed the bailout was necessary to provide stability in the economy and prevent disruption in the financial system. The interest rate cut aimed to revive the economy, help free up credit and make loans cheaper to consumers and businesses. What happened The financial markets remained in turmoil for several months. Credit remains tight to this day, although it loosened significantly compared to when lending nearly came to a halt during the collapse period. Mortgage rates fell significantly after the interest rate cut and amid expectations that the Fed would start buying mortgage-backed securities.

That's on top of the tens of billions of dollars in mortgages it already had been buying each month, making U.S. banks flush with cash.\nThe central bank continues to sell short-term bonds and use the money to buy long-term bonds.\nThe time period during which the Fed will keep interest rates near zero was extended from the end of 2014 to mid-2015.

The central bank pointed out that it was still spending tens of billions of dollars a month to \"maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets\" and promote economic recovery. What happened Months before tapering began, mortgage rates rose in anticipation. When the announcement finally was made in December 2013, mortgage rates rose for a couple of weeks. They have declined since then. In the brief time since tapering began, the effect on home prices can't be separated from housing supply and demand. How mortgage rates have reacted since tapering began Note: Mortgage figures are from Bankrate's weekly national survey of large lenders.\nEnd of QE3 Oct. 29, 2014 What the Fed did The Fed pulled the plug on the third round of its bond-buying program, which had been tapered to just $15 billion by September 2014.\nThe central bank continued reinvesting principal payments from its holdings and rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.\nThe Fed kept the federal funds rate near 0. What was expected Industry experts anticipated that mortgage rates would move higher as a direct result of QE3 ending, since the program was maintaining downward pressure on rates. What happened Mortgage rates increased, but only in the short term. The average for the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose from 4.05% the week before the Fed's October 2014 meeting to 4.1% the week of the meeting. By the end of 2014, rates had fallen from the low 4s to just under 4%.

Sleek, shiny designs and flashy advertisements are good at making subpar products seem desirable. If you\u2019re not a credit card nerd, it can be difficult to sort through the somewhat confusing clutter of terms and conditions to find a halfway decent product. Don\u2019t get sucked into a maelstrom of misleading promo deals and catchy slogans. Here are 5 clear indicators of an inferior rewards credit card.\n1. Rewards under 1%\nThe standard base rate for most rewards credit cards is 1% back on all purchases (usually with bonus categories thrown into the mix). A card that earns less than 1% is not worth your time.\nDetermining the percentage back is not always as simple as it seems. Usually, you can count on reward points being worth a penny apiece, meaning one point per dollar spent equates to a 1% return rate. This is not always the case. Sometimes points are worth considerably more. Sometimes points are worth considerably less. This is vital information when calculating the rewards percentage. (NerdWallet\u2019s credit card finder crunches the numbers for you.)\nAlso be wary of cards that start you at a low rewards rate, promising a higher rate after you hit a certain spending threshold. The Sam\u2019s Club credit card, for example, only yields 0.38% back on the first $3,000 spent annually and 1% for every dollar beyond that. You deserve at least 1% from the very first dollar.\n2. Reward caps\nAnother undesirable characteristic is the implementation of rewards caps. Rewards caps will not always affect you, but you need to know the limits before signing up. The Chase Freedom, for example, imposes a $1,500 cap on 5% earnings every quarter. Many people will never spend that much in the specified categories anyway, but it\u2019s important to realize your true earning potential before applying. Don\u2019t cheat yourself out of rewards. Many, many cards offer unlimited earning (though bonus categories often do have caps).\n3. Limited redemption options\nWhat\u2019s the point of earning rewards if they have no relevance to your life or preferences? Pick a card that offers rewards you actually enjoy. Cash back is always a smart route. However, not all cards that offer cash back will give you a full return rate. Sometimes, redeeming for cash is penalized with a lower percentage returned. Your credit card may advertise 1% rewards, but that could mean 1% when redeemed for gift cards and 0.8% when redeemed for cash.\nBe careful with hotel and airline credit cards as well. You may be limited to redeeming for flight with one specific airline or stays at one specific hotel chain. You can achieve much greater flexibility by opting instead for a general travel credit card that doesn\u2019t restrict you to one particular service. For example, we\u2019d recommend the Capital One Venture over the United MileagePlus Explorer card any day.\n4. Signing bonuses under $100\nMaybe this is getting greedy, but most quality rewards credit cards will offer some sort of signing bonus. A common bonus is $100 (or 10,000 points in most systems) when you spend a certain amount of money within the first few months. Be skeptical of cards that offer less than $100 (though once in a while the ongoing rewards rate is fully worth a smaller bonus).\n5. Useless bonus categories\nThis goes back to choosing a card that fits your spending patterns. A card might offer 5% cash back in certain categories, but if you never spend money within those categories, using that card does little for you. Using the Chase Freedom as an example, during the summer months cardholders get 5% back at gas stations, theme parks and Kohl\u2019s. A family who spends the summer driving to and from theme parks could get a lot of use out of the Freedom during those months. On the other hand, a person spending the summer working in New York City, using public transit to get around, will never tap into those 5% categories."}
{"title": "What Is a VAT Tax?", "text": "The VAT or valued-added tax is a consumption tax levied on goods and services in countries that belong to the European Union. It's considered a consumption tax, because the ultimate consumer actually pays it. Producers, distributors and service-providers only collect the VAT tax and pass it on to the revenue department of the state.\n\nVAT Basics\n\nThe European Union created the VAT in 1967 as a replacement for the many levels of taxation existing at the time in the original member countries, according to the European Commission. Most countries levied taxes at various stages of production, and the total tax rate on the final product or service was sometimes obscured.\n\nBy contrast, the VAT is a fixed percentage of the final price, so the total amount of the tax is clearly visible. Portions are still collected on various stages of production, but the total is a known percentage.\n\nThe VAT applies only to goods or services that are used within the European community. Goods and services aren't taxed when they move between different states in the EU or when they go out of the EU. Business travelers and tourists pay the tax up front, but they may qualify for refunds. An equivalent tax on imports keeps EU products on an equal footing with products from outside.\n\nVAT Terms and Rates\n\nA business under a particular monetary threshold doesn't have to collect or pay VAT taxes, but the threshold depends on the country. The EU requires every member state to charge at least 15 percent for most goods and services, and a special list qualifies for a reduced minimum of 5 percent, according to the European Commission. The actual tax rates vary and are subject to change. According to travel expert Rick Steves, VAT levels typically range between 15 and 25 percent, depending on the country.\n\nGetting Refunds\n\nBusiness travelers in Europe qualify for VAT refunds averaging 20 percent of many typical business expenses, according to the website for VAT It, a company that helps businesses navigate the refund process. Some of these refundable expenses include hotel bills, restaurant bills and transportation. The paperwork is cumbersome and involved, so many companies don't collect what they're owed.\n\nAlthough they can't get VAT refunds on basic travel expenses, tourists qualify for a VAT refund on purchases, according to Rick Steves. In most countries, you must buy a certain euro amount of goods at the same shop to qualify, and the amount depends on the country. Getting the refund as a tourist is also a hassle, Steves reports. You must meet all these requirements:"}

{"title": "One of the Best Asset Classes You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "text": "If you are concerned about the stock market that is reaching all time highs and bond yields, that although higher versus a year ago, are still very low where do you go to invest? This is the same question we have been asking for all our clients. To be sure, virtually every client will retain significant exposure to select stocks and bonds depending on their risk tolerance and goals but recent valuations and yields have pushed us to look into alternative investments.\nThis area of \u2018alternatives\u2019 is broadly defined and mysterious to a lot of investors and even a large amount of advisors. Most of the alternatives we have researched had no or poor true diversification benefits versus some combination of traditional asset classes and the majority had a lackluster return profile. In addition almost all of these had very high fees.\nOne asset class that did impress is little known, but we feel holds significant return and diversification potential. This asset class was unaffected during the 2008 crash and has no correlation to Fed policy, the economy, or interest rates. In addition it has historical (and expected) long term average annual returns of between 5%-10%. This is a combination that is incredibly hard to find, but \u2018insurance linked securities\u2019 appear to fit the bill.\nInsurance linked securities come in two flavors, \u2018catastrophe bonds\u2019 and \u2018quota share\u2019.\nCatastrophe bonds are very short term floating rate (1-2 years) bond securities issued by governments or insurance companies that are seeking to remove natural disaster risk \u2018off their books\u2019. In exchange for accepting this risk they offer competitive yields (5% \u2013 7%/yr. average) which are immune from interest rate and credit risk. The only trigger that will cause a loss of principal is a natural disaster that causes a certain level of insurable losses. This of course has no correlation with anything but the weather.\nQuota Share is an actual slice of an insurance company\u2019s business (incoming premiums minus outgoing losses). This type of security has a higher expected return than catastrophe bonds (7% \u2013 10%/yr. average returns) but with a higher level of risk individually. However if you compile a largely diversified basket of these shares you can reduce risk substantially. This is exactly what we are doing (investing in 10-15 unique quota shares) that span risks from Super bowl cancellation, satellites, natural disasters, pandemics, agriculture, marine, and air travel risk.\nWhile a typical investor has significant exposure to \u2018stock market/economic\u2019 risk and some have large exposure to \u2018interest rate\u2019 risk, very few have any exposure to \u2018insurance risk\u2019. Introducing this other type of risk that is not correlated at to either economic or interest rate risk has a tremendous advantage to an overall portfolio\u2019s risk and return.\nNo asset class is perfect however, so all investors should be aware of a couple important concerns unique to these investments.\nAll-Or-Nothing Payoff: In the case of catastrophe bonds, the vast majority will be an all or nothing proposition in terms of payoff. If the bond triggers are not met the investor (in the vast majority of cases) will get 100% of their principal returned with interest, but if a triggering event does occur the investor will most likely lose 100% of their principal. This makes holding any 1 bond extremely risky and unadvisable. Therefore we are holding a fund that holds many diversified bonds so if any 1 security does trigger it will have a small impact over all.\nIn the case of catastrophe bonds, the vast majority will be an all or nothing proposition in terms of payoff.

Modeling Risks: With both quota share and catastrophe bonds the climate/weather modeling that \u2018creates\u2019 the agreed upon underlying investment return/risk metrics are not perfect and are very long term orientated. What this combination creates in the short term are results that will deviate largely from long term modeled outcomes. Modeling is getting better and better however, and again if you hold enough diversified investments the risk of any one event being modeled incorrectly is greatly mitigated.\nWith both quota share and catastrophe bonds the climate/weather modeling that \u2018creates\u2019 the agreed upon underlying investment return/risk metrics are not perfect and are very long term orientated.

Modeling is getting better and better however, and again if you hold enough diversified investments the risk of any one event being modeled incorrectly is greatly mitigated. Limited Liquidity: Liquidity is more of an issue with quota share than catastrophe bonds, as we hold catastrophe bonds through a normal open end mutual fund we can sell at any time. Even though our quota share will be held through an open end fund as well, it will only have quarterly liquidity, as quota share itself does have little interim liquidity. If purchasing the timeline for the funds invested should be for no less than 3-5 years anyway as it is important to hold through a full insurance premium cycle.\nWe will be moving approximately 10% of most of our client\u2019s portfolio into the asset class with the allocation coming out of both stocks and fixed income within the next month."}
{"title": "What Does Grade Mean in a Tax Assessment?", "text": "Property tax bills are based on the property's assessed value. The county assessor's office is responsible for deciding what the assessed value is. Two deciding factors are the grade and CDU (condition, desirability and utility). Grade is an evaluation of the construction materials and level of craftsmanship used to build houses. The majority of assessors have around eight to 15 different grades to describe homes.\n\nConstruction grades can raise or lower property values.\n\nInitial Estimate\n\nSometimes appraisers do not accurately assess property grades. Entry-level appraisers usually make the initial grade estimate. The county assessment office's grade estimate for houses within a subdivision often varies for homes that are almost identical. This happens when two or more appraisers evaluate property grades within the same subdivision. The CDU, or condition factor, cannot be relied upon to give accurate information; however, the appraisal district uses it as a key element in valuing property.\n\nInaccuracies\n\nThe county assessment offices often assign grades to homes that are several decades old. However, a county appraiser probably has not been in the house since it was built. Assessment offices do factor in structural problems that may have developed over the years or improvements the owners have made. A county appraiser usually visits homes while construction is still in process, again when they are finished, and does not return. If an owner can document that either the grade or CDU for his home is not accurate, the county assessment office can correct it and revise the assessed value.\n\nBuilder-Grade\n\nBuilder-grade materials are of average quality. They are usually used for framing houses and for preconstructed, mass-produced furniture. Of all the grades, builder-grade is the lowest rated in terms of quality. Builder-grade furniture is often made of particle board and plywood. Doors and floors are made of particle board with a wood or plastic veneer. If an assessor decides a property is made up of builder-grade materials, it will assess it lower, because it is not as likely to last as long as better quality or custom-made properties.\n\nConsiderations\n\nProperty owners are able to appeal the assessor's decision of the value of their home. Along with the grade and CDU, property owners should verify that the assessor has the correct year that the house was built and renovated. Some appraisal districts still value renovations made decades ago, even though the value of a renovation may only last for a few years."}
